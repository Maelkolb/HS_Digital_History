the church history of eusebius book i chapter the plan of the work it be my purpose to write an account of the succession of the holy apostle a well a of the time which have elapse from the day of our savior to our own and to relate the many important event which be say to have occur in the history of the church and to mention those who have govern and preside over the church in the most prominent parish and those who in each generation have proclaim the divine word either orally or in write it be my purpose also to give the name and number and time of those who through love of innovation have run into the great error and proclaim themselves discoverer of knowledge falsely socalled have like fierce wolf unmercifully devastate the flock of christ it be my intention moreover to recount the misfortune which immediately come upon the whole jewish nation in consequence of their plot against our savior and to record the way and the time in which the divine word have be attack by the gentile and to describe the character of those who at various period have contend for it in the face of blood and of torture a well a the confession which have be make in our own day and finally the gracious and kindly succor which our savior have afford them all since i propose to write of all these thing i shall commence my work with the begin of the dispensation of our savior and lord jesus christ but at the outset i must crave for my work the indulgence of the wise for i confess that it be beyond my power to produce a perfect and complete history and since i be the first to enter upon the subject i be attempt to traverse a it be a lonely and untrodden path i pray that i may have god a my guide and the power of the lord a my aid since i be unable to find even the bare footstep of those who have travel the way before me except in brief fragment in which some in one way others in another have transmit to u particular account of the time in which they live from afar they raise their voice like torch and they cry out a from some lofty and conspicuous watchtower admonish u where to walk and how to direct the course of our work steadily and safely have gather therefore from the matter mention here and there by them whatever we consider important for the present work and have plucked like flower from a meadow the appropriate passage from ancient writer we shall endeavor to embody the whole in an historical narrative content if we preserve the memory of the succession of the apostle of our savior if not indeed of all yet of the most renowned of them in those church which be the most note and which even to the present time be held in honor this work seem to me of especial importance because i know of no ecclesiastical writer who have devote himself to this subject and i hope that it will appear most useful to those who be fond of historical research i have already give an epitome of these thing in the chronological canon which i have compose but notwithstanding that i have undertaken in the present work to write a full an account of them a i be able my work will begin a i have say with the dispensation of the savior christ which be loftier and great than human conception and with a discussion of his divinity for it be necessary inasmuch a we derive even our name from christ for one who proposes to write a history of the church to begin with the very origin of christ dispensation a dispensation more divine than many think chapter summary view of the preexistence and divinity of our savior and lord jesus christ since in christ there be a twofold nature and the one in so far a he be thought of a god resembles the head of the body while the other may be compare with the foot in so far a he for the sake of our salvation put on human nature with the same passion a our own the follow work will be complete only if we begin with the chief and lordly event of all his history in this way will the antiquity and divinity of christianity be show to those who suppose it of recent and foreign origin and imagine that it appear only yesterday no language be sufficient to express the origin and the worth the be and the nature of christ wherefore also the divine spirit say in the prophecy who shall declare his generation for none knoweth the father except the son neither can any one know the son adequately except the father alone who hath begotten him for alone who beside the father could clearly understand the light which be before the world the intellectual and essential wisdom which exist before the age the living word which be in the begin with the father and which be god the first and only begotten of god which be before every creature and creation visible and invisible the commanderinchief of the rational and immortal host of heaven the messenger of the great counsel the executor of the father unspoken will the creator with the father of all thing the second cause of the universe after the father the true and onlybegotten son of god the lord and god and king of all create thing the one who have receive dominion and power with divinity itself and with might and honor from the father a it be say in regard to him in the mystical passage of scripture which speak of his divinity in the begin be the word and the word be with god and the word be god all thing be make by him and without him be not anything make this too the great moses teach when a the most ancient of all the prophet he describes under the influence of the divine spirit the creation and arrangement of the universe he declares that the maker of the world and the creator of all thing yield to christ himself and to none other than his own clearly divine and firstborn word the make of inferior thing and commune with him respect the creation of man for say he god say let u make man in our image and in our likeness and another of the prophet confirms this speak of god in his hymn a follow he spake and they be make he command and they be create he here introduces the father and maker a ruler of all command with a kingly nod and second to him the divine word none other than the one who be proclaim by u a carry out the father command all that be say to have excel in righteousness and piety since the creation of man the great servant moses and before him in the first place abraham and his child and a many righteous men and prophet a afterward appear have contemplate him with the pure eye of the mind and have recognize him and offer to him the worship which be due him a son of god but he by no mean neglectful of the reverence due to the father be appoint to teach the knowledge of the father to them all for instance the lord god it be say appear a a common man to abraham while he be sit at the oak of mambre and he immediately fail down although he saw a man with his eye nevertheless worship him a god and sacrifice to him a lord and confess that he be not ignorant of his identity when he uttered the word lord the judge of all the earth wilt thou not execute righteous judgment for if it be unreasonable to suppose that the unbegotten and immutable essence of the almighty god be change into the form of man or that it deceive the eye of the beholder with the appearance of some create thing and if it be unreasonable to suppose on the other hand that the scripture should falsely invent such thing when the god and lord who judgeth all the earth and executeth judgment be see in the form of a man who else can be call if it be not lawful to call him the first cause of all thing than his only preexistent word concern whom it be say in the psalm he sent his word and heal them and deliver them from their destruction moses most clearly proclaims him second lord after the father when he say the lord rain upon sodom and gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord the divine scripture also call him god when he appear again to jacob in the form of a man and say to jacob thy name shall be call no more jacob but israel shall be thy name because thou hast prevail with god wherefore also jacob call the name of that place vision of god say for i have see god face to face and my life be preserve nor be it admissible to suppose that the theophany record be appearance of subordinate angel and minister of god for whenever any of these appear to men the scripture do not conceal the fact but call them by name not god nor lord but angel a it be easy to prove by numberless testimony joshua also the successor of moses call him a leader of the heavenly angel and archangel and of the supermundane power and a lieutenant of the father entrust with the second rank of sovereignty and rule over all captain of the host of the lord although he saw him not otherwise than again in the form and appearance of a man for it be write and it come to pas when joshua be at jericho that he look and saw a man stand over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua go unto him and say art thou for u or for our adversary and he say unto him a captain of the host of the lord be i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and say unto him lord what dost thou command thy servant and the captain of the lord say unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest be holy you will perceive also from the same word that this be no other than he who talk with moses for the scripture say in the same word and with reference to the same one when the lord saw that he drew near to see the lord call to him out of the bush and say moses moses and he say what be it and he say draw not nigh hither loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest be holy ground and he say unto him i be the god of thy father the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob and that there be a certain substance which live and subsist before the world and which minister unto the father and god of the universe for the formation of all create thing and which be call the word of god and wisdom we may learn to quote other proof in addition to those already cite from the mouth of wisdom herself who reveals most clearly through solomon the follow mystery concern herself i wisdom have dwelt with prudence and knowledge and i have invoked understand through me king reign and prince ordain righteousness through me the great be magnify and through me sovereign rule the earth to which she add the lord create me in the begin of his way for his work before the world he establish me in the begin before he make the earth before he make the depth before the mountain be settle before all hill he begat me when he prepared the heaven i be present with him and when he establish the fountain of the region under heaven i be with him dispose i be the one in whom he delighted daily i rejoice before him at all time when he be rejoice at have complete the world that the divine word therefore preexist and appear to some if not to all have thus be briefly show by u but why the gospel be not preach in ancient time to all men and to all nation a it be now will appear from the follow consideration the life of the ancient be not of such a kind a to permit them to receive the allwise and allvirtuous teach of christ for immediately in the begin after his original life of blessedness the first man despise the command of god and fell into this mortal and perishable state and exchange his former divinely inspire luxury for this curseladen earth his descendant have fill our earth show themselves much bad with the exception of one here and there and enter upon a certain brutal and insupportable mode of life they thought neither of city nor state neither of art nor science they be ignorant even of the name of law and of justice of virtue and of philosophy a nomad they pass their life in desert like wild and fierce beast destroy by an excess of voluntary wickedness the natural reason of man and the seed of thought and of culture implant in the human soul they give themselves wholly over to all kind of profanity now seduce one another now slay one another now eat human flesh and now dare to wage war with the god and to undertake those battle of the giant celebrate by all now planning to fortify earth against heaven and in the madness of ungoverned pride to prepare an attack upon the very god of all on account of these thing when they conduct themselves thus the allseeing god sent down upon them flood and conflagration a upon a wild forest spread over the whole earth he cut them down with continuous famine and plague with war and with thunderbolt from heaven a if to check some terrible and obstinate disease of soul with more severe punishment then when the excess of wickedness have overwhelmed nearly all the race like a deep fit of drunkenness beclouding and darken the mind of men the firstborn and firstcreated wisdom of god the preexistent word himself induced by his exceed love for man appear to his servant now in the form of angel and again to one and another of those ancient who enjoy the favor of god in his own person a the save power of god not otherwise however than in the shape of man because it be impossible to appear in any other way and a by them the seed of piety be sown among a multitude of men and the whole nation descend from the hebrew devote themselves persistently to the worship of god he impart to them through the prophet moses a to multitude still corrupt by their ancient practice image and symbol of a certain mystic sabbath and of circumcision and element of other spiritual principle but he do not grant them a complete knowledge of the mystery themselves but when their law become celebrate and like a sweet odor be diffuse among all men a a result of their influence the disposition of the majority of the heathen be soften by the lawgiver and philosopher who arose on every side and their wild and savage brutality be change into mildness so that they enjoy deep peace friendship and social intercourse then finally at the time of the origin of the roman empire there appear again to all men and nation throughout the world who have be a it be previously assist and be now fit to receive the knowledge of the father that same teacher of virtue the minister of the father in all good thing the divine and heavenly word of god in a human body not at all differ in substance from our own he do and suffer the thing which have be prophesy for it have be foretold that one who be at the same time man and god should come and dwell in the world should perform wonderful work and should show himself a teacher to all nation of the piety of the father the marvelous nature of his birth and his new teach and his wonderful work have also be foretold so likewise the manner of his death his resurrection from the dead and finally his divine ascension into heaven for instance daniel the prophet under the influence of the divine spirit see his kingdom at the end of time be inspire thus to describe the divine vision in language fit to human comprehension for i beheld he say until throne be place and the ancient of day do sit whose garment be white a snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne be a flame of fire and his wheel burning fire a river of fire flow before him thousand thousand minister unto him and ten thousand time ten thousand stood before him he appoint judgment and the book be open and again i saw say he and behold one like the son of man come with the cloud of heaven and he hasten unto the ancient of day and be brought into his presence and there be give him the dominion and the glory and the kingdom and all people tribe and tongue serve him his dominion be an everlasting dominion which shall not pas away and his kingdom shall not be destroyed it be clear that these word can refer to no one else than to our savior the god word who be in the begin with god and who be call the son of man because of his final appearance in the flesh but since we have collect in separate book a the selection from the prophet which relate to our savior jesus christ and have arrange in a more logical form those thing which have be reveal concern him what have be say will suffice for the present chapter the name jesus and also the name christ be know from the begin and be honor by the inspire prophet it be now the proper place to show that the very name jesus and also the name christ be honor by the ancient prophet beloved of god moses be the first to make know the name of christ a a name especially august and glorious when he deliver type and symbol of heavenly thing and mysterious image in accordance with the oracle which say to him look that thou make all thing accord to the pattern which be show thee in the mount he consecrate a man high priest of god in so far a that be possible and him he call christ and thus to this dignity of the high priesthood which in his opinion surpass the most honorable position among men he attach for the sake of honor and glory the name of christ he knew so well that in christ be something divine and the same one foresee under the influence of the divine spirit the name jesus dignify it also with a certain distinguish privilege for the name of jesus which have never be uttered among men before the time of moses he apply first and only to the one who he knew would receive after his death again a a type and symbol the supreme command his successor therefore who have not hitherto born the name jesus but have be call by another name au which have be give him by his parent he now call jesus bestowing the name upon him a a gift of honor far great than any kingly diadem for jesus himself the son of nave bore a resemblance to our savior in the fact that he alone after moses and after the completion of the symbolical worship which have be transmit by him succeed to the government of the true and pure religion thus moses bestow the name of our savior jesus christ a a mark of the high honor upon the two men who in his time surpass all the rest of the people in virtue and glory namely upon the high priest and upon his own successor in the government and the prophet that come after also clearly foretold christ by name predict at the same time the plot which the jewish people would form against him and the call of the nation through him jeremiah for instance speaks a follow the spirit before our face christ the lord be take in their destruction of whom we say under his shadow we shall live among the nation and david in perplexity say why do the nation rage and the people imagine vain thing the king of the earth set themselves in array and the ruler be gather together against the lord and against his christ to which he add in the person of christ himself the lord say unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ask of me and i will give thee the nation for thine inheritance and the uttermost part of the earth for thy possession and not only those who be honor with the high priesthood and who for the sake of the symbol be anoint with especially prepared oil be adorn with the name of christ among the hebrew but also the king whom the prophet anoint under the influence of the divine spirit and thus constitute a it be typical christ for they also bore in their own person type of the royal and sovereign power of the true and only christ the divine word who ruleth over all and we have be told also that certain of the prophet themselves become by the act of anoint christ in type so that all these have reference to the true christ the divinely inspire and heavenly word who be the only high priest of all and the only king of every creature and the father only supreme prophet of prophet and a proof of this be that no one of those who be of old symbolically anoint whether priest or king or prophet possess so great a power of inspire virtue a be exhibit by our savior and lord jesus the true and only christ none of them at least however superior in dignity and honor they may have be for many generation among their own people ever give to their follower the name of christian from their own typical name of christ neither be divine honor ever render to any one of them by their subject nor after their death be the disposition of their follower such that they be ready to die for the one whom they honor and never do so great a commotion arise among all the nation of the earth in respect to any one of that age for the mere symbol could not act with such power among them a the truth itself which be exhibit by our savior he although he receive no symbol and type of high priesthood from any one although he be not born of a race of priest although he be not elevate to a kingdom by military guard although he be not a prophet like those of old although he obtain no honor nor preeminence among the jew nevertheless be adorn by the father with all if not with the symbol yet with the truth itself and therefore although he do not posse like honor with those whom we have mention he be call christ more than all of them and a himself the true and only christ of god he have fill the whole earth with the truly august and sacred name of christian commit to his follower no longer type and image but the uncovered virtue themselves and a heavenly life in the very doctrine of truth and he be not anoint with oil prepared from material substance but a befits divinity with the divine spirit himself by participation in the unbegotten deity of the father and this be taught also again by isaiah who exclaims a if in the person of christ himself the spirit of the lord be upon me therefore hath he anoint me he hath sent me to preach the gospel to the poor to proclaim deliverance to captive and recovery of sight to the blind and not only isaiah but also david address him say thy throne o god be forever and ever a scepter of equity be the scepter of thy kingdom thou hast love righteousness and hast hat iniquity therefore god thy god hath anoint thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellow here the scripture call him god in the first verse in the second it honor him with a royal scepter then a little farther on after the divine and royal power it represent him in the third place a have become christ be anoint not with oil make of material substance but with the divine oil of gladness it thus indicates his especial honor far superior to and different from that of those who a type be of old anoint in a more material way and elsewhere the same writer speaks of him a follow the lord say unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemy thy footstool and out of the womb before the morning star have i begotten thee the lord hath sworn and he will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedec but this melchizedec be introduce in the holy scripture a a priest of the most high god not consecrate by any anoint oil especially prepared and not even belonging by descent to the priesthood of the jew wherefore after his order but not after the order of the others who receive symbol and type be our savior proclaim with an appeal to an oath christ and priest history therefore do not relate that he be anoint corporeally by the jew nor that he belong to the lineage of priest but that he come into existence from god himself before the morning star that be before the organization of the world and that he obtain an immortal and undecaying priesthood for eternal age but it be a great and convincing proof of his incorporeal and divine unction that he alone of all those who have ever exist be even to the present day call christ by all men throughout the world and be confess and witness to under this name and be commemorate both by greek and barbarian and even to this day be honor a a king by his follower throughout the world and be admire a more than a prophet and be glorify a the true and only high priest of god and besides all this a the preexistent word of god call into be before all age he have receive august honor from the father and be worship a god but most wonderful of all be the fact that we who have consecrate ourselves to him honor him not only with our voice and with the sound of word but also with complete elevation of soul so that we choose to give testimony unto him rather than to preserve our own life i have of necessity preface my history with these matter in order that no one judging from the date of his incarnation may think that our savior and lord jesus the christ have but recently come into be chapter the religion proclaim by him to all nation be neither new nor strange but that no one may suppose that his doctrine be new and strange a if it be frame by a man of recent origin differ in no respect from other men let u now briefly consider this point also it be admit that when in recent time the appearance of our savior jesus christ have become know to all men there immediately make it appearance a new nation a nation confessedly not small and not dwell in some corner of the earth but the most numerous and pious of all nation indestructible and unconquerable because it always receives assistance from god this nation thus suddenly appear at the time appoint by the inscrutable counsel of god be the one which have be honor by all with the name of christ one of the prophet when he saw beforehand with the eye of the divine spirit that which be to be be so astonish at it that he cry out who hath heard of such thing and who hath spoken thus hath the earth brought forth in one day and hath a nation be born at once and the same prophet give a hint also of the name by which the nation be to be call when he say those that serve me shall be call by a new name which shall be bless upon the earth but although it be clear that we be new and that this new name of christian have really but recently be know among all nation nevertheless our life and our conduct with our doctrine of religion have not be lately invent by u but from the first creation of man so to speak have be establish by the natural understand of divinely favor men of old that this be so we shall show in the follow way that the hebrew nation be not new but be universally honor on account of it antiquity be know to all the book and writing of this people contain account of ancient men rare indeed and few in number but nevertheless distinguish for piety and righteousness and every other virtue of these some excellent men live before the flood others of the son and descendant of noah live after it among them abraham whom the hebrew celebrate a their own founder and forefather if any one should assert that all those who have enjoy the testimony of righteousness from abraham himself back to the first man be christian in fact if not in name he would not go beyond the truth for that which the name indicates that the christian man through the knowledge and the teach of christ be distinguish for temperance and righteousness for patience in life and manly virtue and for a profession of piety toward the one and only god over all all that be zealously practice by them not less than by u they do not care about circumcision of the body neither do we they do not care about observe sabbath nor do we they do not avoid certain kind of food neither do they regard the other distinction which moses first deliver to their posterity to be observe a symbol nor do christian of the present day do such thing but they also clearly knew the very christ of god for it have already be show that he appear unto abraham that he impart revelation to isaac that he talk with jacob that he held converse with moses and with the prophet that come after hence you will find those divinely favor men honor with the name of christ accord to the passage which say of them touch not my christ and do my prophet no harm so that it be clearly necessary to consider that religion which have lately be preach to all nation through the teach of christ the first and most ancient of all religion and the one discover by those divinely favor men in the age of abraham if it be say that abraham a long time afterward be give the command of circumcision we reply that nevertheless before this it be declare that he have receive the testimony of righteousness through faith a the divine word say abraham believe in god and it be count unto him for righteousness and indeed unto abraham who be thus before his circumcision a justified man there be give by god who reveal himself unto him but this be christ himself the word of god a prophecy in regard to those who in come age should be justified in the same way a he the prophecy be in the follow word and in thee shall all the tribe of the earth be bless and again he shall become a nation great and numerous and in him shall all the nation of the earth be bless it be permissible to understand this a fulfil in u for he have renounce the superstition of his father and the former error of his life and have confess the one god over all and have worship him with deed of virtue and not with the service of the law which be afterward give by moses be justified by faith in christ the word of god who appear unto him to him then who be a man of this character it be say that all the tribe and all the nation of the earth should be bless in him but that very religion of abraham have reappear at the present time practice in deed more efficacious than word by christian alone throughout the world what then should prevent the confession that we who be of christ practice one and the same mode of life and have one and the same religion a those divinely favor men of old whence it be evident that the perfect religion commit to u by the teach of christ be not new and strange but if the truth must be spoken it be the first and the true religion this may suffice for this subject chapter the time of his appearance among men and now after this necessary introduction to our propose history of the church we can enter so to speak upon our journey begin with the appearance of our savior in the flesh and we invoke god the father of the word and him of whom we have be speak jesus christ himself our savior and lord the heavenly word of god a our aid and fellowlaborer in the narration of the truth it be in the fortysecond year of the reign of augustus and the twentyeighth after the subjugation of egypt and the death of antony and cleopatra with whom the dynasty of the ptolemy in egypt come to an end that our savior and lord jesus christ be born in bethlehem of judea accord to the prophecy which have be uttered concern him his birth take place during the first census while cyrenius be governor of syria flavius josephus the most celebrate of hebrew historian also mention this census which be take during cyrenius term of office in the same connection he give an account of the uprise of the galilean which take place at that time of which also luke among our writer have make mention in the act in the follow word after this man rise up juda of galilee in the day of the tax and drew away a multitude after him he also perish and all even a many a obeyed him be disperse the abovementioned author in the eighteenth book of his antiquity in agreement with these word add the follow which we quote exactly cyrenius a member of the senate one who have held other office and have l pass through them all to the consulship a man also of great dignity in other respect come to syria with a small retinue be sent by caesar to be a judge of the nation and to make an assessment of their property and after a little he say but juda a gaulonite from a city call gamala take with him sadduchus a pharisee urge the people to revolt both of them say that the taxation meant nothing else than downright slavery and exhort the nation to defend their liberty and in the second book of his history of the jewish war he writes a follow concern the same man at this time a certain galilean whose name be juda persuade his countryman to revolt declare that they be coward if they submit to pay tribute to the roman and if they endure besides god master who be mortal these thing be record by josephus chapter about the time of christ in accordance with prophecy the ruler who have govern the jewish nation in regular succession from the day of antiquity come to an end and herod the first foreigner become king when herod the first ruler of foreign blood become king the prophecy of moses receive it fulfillment accord to which there should not be want a prince of judah nor a ruler from his loin until he come for whom it be reserve the latter he also show be to be the expectation of the nation this prediction remain unfulfilled so long a it be permit them to live under ruler from their own nation that be from the time of moses to the reign of augustus under the latter herod the first foreigner be give the kingdom of the jew by the roman a josephus relates he be an idumean on his father side and an arabian on his mother but africanus who be also no common writer say that they who be more accurately inform about him report that he be a son of antipater and that the latter be the son of a certain herod of ascalon one of the socalled servant of the temple of apollo this antipater have be take a prisoner while a boy by idumean robber live with them because his father be a poor man be unable to pay a ransom for him grow up in their practice he be afterward befriend by hyrcanus the high priest of the jew a son of his be that herod who live in the time of our savior when the kingdom of the jew have devolve upon such a man the expectation of the nation be accord to prophecy already at the door for with him their prince and governor who have rule in regular succession from the time of moses come to an end before their captivity and their transportation to babylon they be rule by saul first and then by david and before the king leader govern them who be call judge and who come after moses and his successor jesus after their return from babylon they continued to have without interruption an aristocratic form of government with an oligarchy for the priest have the direction of affair until pompey the roman general take jerusalem by force and defile the holy place by enter the very innermost sanctuary of the temple aristobulus who by the right of ancient succession have be up to that time both king and high priest he sent with his child in chain to rome and give to hyrcanus brother of aristobulus the high priesthood while the whole nation of the jew be make tributary to the roman from that time but hyrcanus who be the last of the regular line of high priest be very soon afterward take prisoner by the parthian and herod the first foreigner a i have already say be make king of the jewish nation by the roman senate and by augustus under him christ appear in bodily shape and the expect salvation of the nation and their call follow in accordance with prophecy from this time the prince and ruler of judah i mean of the jewish nation come to an end and a a natural consequence the order of the high priesthood which from ancient time have proceed regularly in closest succession from generation to generation be immediately thrown into confusion of these thing josephus be also a witness who show that when herod be make king by the roman he no longer appoint the high priest from the ancient line but give the honor to certain obscure person a course similar to that of herod in the appointment of the priest be pursue by his son archelaus and after him by the roman who take the government into their own hand the same writer show that herod be the first that lock up the sacred garment of the high priest under his own seal and refuse to permit the high priest to keep it for themselves the same course be follow by archelaus after him and after archelaus by the roman these thing have be record by u in order to show that another prophecy have be fulfil in the appearance of our savior jesus christ for the scripture in the book of daniel have expressly mention a certain number of week until the come of christ of which we have treat in other book most clearly prophesies that after the completion of those week the unction among the jew should totally perish and this it have be clearly show be fulfil at the time of the birth of our savior jesus christ this have be necessarily premise by u a a proof of the correctness of the time chapter the allege discrepancy in the gospel in regard to the genealogy of christ matthew and luke in their gospel have give u the genealogy of christ differently and many suppose that they be at variance with one another since a a consequence every believer in ignorance of the truth have be zealous to invent some explanation which shall harmonize the two passage permit u to subjoin the account of the matter which have come down to u and which be give by africanus who be mention by u just above in his epistle to aristides where he discus the harmony of the gospel genealogy after refute the opinion of others a force and deceptive he give the account which he have receive from tradition in these word for whereas the name of the generation be reckon in israel either accord to nature or accord to law accord to nature by the succession of legitimate offspring and accord to law whenever another raise up a child to the name of a brother die childless for because a clear hope of resurrection be not yet give they have a representation of the future promise by a kind of mortal resurrection in order that the name of the one decease might be perpetuate whereas then some of those who be insert in this genealogical table succeed by natural descent the son to the father while others though born of one father be ascribed by name to another mention be make of both of those who be progenitor in fact and of those who be so only in name thus neither of the gospel be in error for one reckons by nature the other by law for the line of descent from solomon and that from nathan be so involve the one with the other by the raise up of child to the childless and by second marriage that the same person be justly consider to belong at one time to one at another time to another that be at one time to the repute father at another to the actual father so that both these account be strictly true and come down to joseph with considerable intricacy indeed yet quite accurately but in order that what i have say may be make clear i shall explain the interchange of the generation if we reckon the generation from david through solomon the third from the end be found to be matthan who begat jacob the father of joseph but if with luke we reckon them from nathan the son of david in like manner the third from the end be melchi whose son eli be the father of joseph for joseph be the son of eli the son of melchi joseph therefore be the object propose to u it must be show how it be that each be record to be his father both jacob who derive his descent from solomon and eli who derive his from nathan first how it be that these two jacob and eli be brother and then how it be that their father matthan and melchi although of different family be declare to be grandfather of joseph matthan and melchi have married in succession the same woman begat child who be uterine brother for the law do not prohibit a widow whether such by divorce or by the death of her husband from marry another by estha then for this be the woman name accord to tradition matthan a descendant of solomon first begat jacob and when matthan be dead melchi who trace his descent back to nathan be of the same tribe but of another family married her a before say and begat a son eli thus we shall find the two jacob and eli although belonging to different family yet brother by the same mother of these the one jacob when his brother eli have die childless take the latter wife and begat by her a son to joseph his own son by nature n and in accordance with reason wherefore also it be write jacob begat joseph but accord to law he be the son of eli for jacob be the brother of the latter raise up seed to him hence the genealogy trace through him will not be render void which the evangelist matthew in his enumeration give thus jacob begat joseph but luke on the other hand say who be the son a be suppose for this he also add of joseph the son of eli the son of melchi for he could not more clearly express the generation accord to law and the expression he begat he have omit in his genealogical table up to the end trace the genealogy back to adam the son of god this interpretation be neither incapable of proof nor be it an idle conjecture for the relative of our lord accord to the flesh whether with the desire of boasting or simply wish to state the fact in either case truly have band down the follow account some idumean robber have attack ascalon a city of palestine carry away from a temple of apollo which stood near the wall in addition to other booty antipater son of a certain temple slave name herod and since the priest be not able to pay the ransom for his son antipater be brought up in the custom of the idumeans and afterward be befriend by hyrcanus the high priest of the jew and have be sent by hyrcanus on an embassy to pompey and have restore to him the kingdom which have be invade by his brother aristobulus he have the good fortune to be name procurator of palestine but antipater have be slain by those who be envious of his great good fortune be succeed by his son herod who be afterward by a decree of the senate make king of the jew under antony and augustus his son be herod and the other tetrarchs these account agree also with those of the greek but a there have be kept in the archive up to that time the genealogy of the hebrew a well a of those who trace their lineage back to proselyte such a achior the ammonite and ruth the moabites and to those who be mingle with the israelite and come out of egypt with them herod inasmuch a the lineage of the israelite contribute nothing to his advantage and since he be goad with the consciousness of his own ignoble extraction burn all the genealogical record think that he might appear of noble origin if no one else be able from the public register to trace back his lineage to the patriarch or proselyte and to those mingle with them who be call georae a few of the careful however have obtain private record of their own either by remember the name or by get them in some other way from the register pride themselves on preserve the memory of their noble extraction among these be those already mention call desposyni on account of their connection with the family of the savior come from nazara and cochaba village of judea into other part of the world they drew the aforesaid genealogy from memory and from the book of daily record a faithfully a possible whether then the case stand thus or not no one could find a clearer explanation accord to my own opinion and that of every candid person and let this suffice u for although we can urge no testimony in it support we have nothing well or truer to offer in any case the gospel state the truth and at the end of the same epistle he add these word matthan who be descend from solomon begat jacob and when matthan be dead melchi who be descend from nathan begat eli by the same woman eli and jacob be thus uterine brother eli have die childless jacob raise up seed to him begetting joseph his own son by nature but by law the son of eli thus joseph be the son of both thus far africanus and the lineage of joseph be thus trace mary also be virtually show to be of the same tribe with him since accord to the law of moses intermarriage between different tribe be not permit for the command be to marry one of the same family and lineage so that the inheritance may not pas from tribe to tribe this may suffice here chapter the cruelty of herod toward the infant and the manner of his death when christ be born accord to the prophecy in bethlehem of judea at the time indicate herod be not a little disturbed by the enquiry of the magi who come from the east ask where he who be born king of the jew be to be found for they have see his star and this be their reason for take so long a journey for they earnestly desire to worship the infant a god for he imagine that his kingdom might be endanger and he enquire therefore of the doctor of the law who belong to the jewish nation where they expect christ to be born when he learn that the prophecy of micah announce that bethlehem be to be his birthplace he command in a single edict all the male infant in bethlehem and all it border that be two year of age or less accord to the time which he have accurately ascertain from the magi to be slain suppose that jesus a be indeed likely would share the same fate a the others of his own age but the child anticipate the snare be carry into egypt by his parent who have learn from an angel that appear unto them what be about to happen these thing be record by the holy scripture in the gospel it be worth while in addition to this to observe the reward which herod receive for his dare crime against christ and those of the same age for immediately without the least delay the divine vengeance overtook him while he be still alive and give him a foretaste of what he be to receive after death it be not possible to relate here how he tarnished the suppose felicity of his reign by successive calamity in his family by the murder of wife and child and others of his near relative and dearest friend the account which cast every other tragic drama into the shade be detailed at length in the history of josephus how immediately after his crime against our savior and the other infant the punishment sent by god drove him on to his death we can best learn from the word of that historian who in the seventeenth book of his antiquity of the jew writes a follow concern his end but the disease of herod grow more severe god inflict punishment for his crime for a slow fire burn in him which be not so apparent to those who touch him but augment his internal distress for he have a terrible desire for food which it be not possible to resist he be affected also with ulceration of the intestine and with especially severe pain in the colon while a watery and transparent humor settle about his foot he suffer also from a similar trouble in his abdomen nay more his privy member be putrefy and produce worm he found also excessive difficulty in breathing and it be particularly disagreeable because of the offensiveness of the odor and the rapidity of respiration he have convulsion also in every limb which give him uncontrollable strength it be say indeed by those who possess the power of divination and wisdom to explain such event that god have inflict this punishment upon the king on account of his great impiety the writer mention above recount these thing in the work refer to and in the second book of his history he give a similar account of the same herod which run a follow the disease then seize upon his whole body and distract it by various torment for he have a slow fever and the itch of the skin of his whole body be insupportable he suffer also from continuous pain in his colon and there be swelling on his foot like those of a person suffer from dropsy while his abdomen be inflame and his privy member so putrefy a to produce worm besides this he could breathe only in an upright posture and then only with difficulty and he have convulsion in all his limb so that the diviner say that his disease be a punishment but he although wrestling with such suffering nevertheless clung to life and hop for safety and devise method of cure for instance cross over jordan he use the warm bath at callirhoe which flow into the lake asphaltites but be themselves sweet enough to drink his physician here thought that they could warm his whole body again by mean of heat oil but when they have let him down into a tub fill with oil his eye become weak and turn up like the eye of a dead person but when his attendant raise an outcry he recover at the noise but finally despair of a cure he command about fifty drachma to be distribute among the soldier and great sum to be give to his general and friend then return he come to jericho where be seize with melancholy he plan to commit an impious deed a if challenge death itself for collect from every town the most illustrious men of all judea he command that they be shut up in the socalled hippodrome and have summon salome his sister and her husband alexander he say i know that the jew will rejoice at my death but i may be lament by others and have a splendid funeral if you be willing to perform my command when i shall expire surround these men who be now under guard a quickly a possible with soldier and slay them in order that all judea and every house may weep for me even against their will and after a little josephus say and again he be so torture by want of food and by a convulsive cough that overcome by his pain he plan to anticipate his fate take an apple he ask also for a knife for he be accustom to cut apple and eat them then look round to see that there be no one to hinder he raise his right hand a if to stab himself in addition to these thing the same writer record that he slew another of his own son before his death the third one slain by his command and that immediately afterward he breathe his last not without excessive pain such be the end of herod who suffer a just punishment for his slaughter of the child of bethlehem which be the result of his plot against our savior after this an angel appear in a dream to joseph in egypt and command him to go to judea with the child and it mother reveal to him that those who have sought the life of the child be dead to this the evangelist add but when he heard that archelaus do reign in the room of his father herod he be afraid to go thither notwithstanding be warn of god in a dream he turn aside into the part of galilee chapter the time of pilate the historian already mention agrees with the evangelist in regard to the fact that archelaus succeed to the government after herod he record the manner in which he receive the kingdom of the jew by the will of his father herod and by the decree of caesar augustus and how after he have reign ten year he lose his kingdom and his brother philip and herod the young with lysanias still rule their own tetrarchies the same writer in the eighteenth book of his antiquity say that about the twelfth year of the reign of tiberius who have succeed to the empire after augustus have rule fiftyseven year pontius pilate be entrust with the government of judea and that he remain there ten full year almost until the death of tiberius accordingly the forgery of those who have recently give currency to act against our savior be clearly prove for the very date give in them show the falsehood of their fabricator for the thing which they have dare to say concern the passion of the savior be put into the fourth consulship of tiberius which occur in the seventh year of his reign at which time it be plain that pilate be not yet ruling in judea if the testimony of josephus be to be believe who clearly show in the abovementioned work that pilate be make procurator of judea by tiberius in the twelfth year of his reign chapter the high priest of the jew under whom christ taught it be in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius accord to the evangelist and in the fourth year of the governorship of pontius pilate while herod and lysanias and philip be ruling the rest of judea that our savior and lord jesus the christ of god be about thirty year of age come to john for baptism and begin the promulgation of the gospel the divine scripture say moreover that he pass the entire time of his ministry under the high priest anna and caiaphas show that in the time which belong to the priesthood of those two men the whole period of his teach be complete since he begin his work during the high priesthood of anna and taught until caiaphas held the office the entire time do not comprise quite four year for the rite of the law have be already abolish since that time the customary usage in connection with the worship of god accord to which the high priest acquire his office by hereditary descent and held it for life be also annul and there be appoint to the high priesthood by the roman governor now one and now another person who continued in office not more than one year josephus relates that there be four high priest in succession from anna to caiaphas thus in the same book of the antiquity he writes a follow valerius grater have put an end to the priesthood of ananus appoints ishmael the son of fabi high priest and have remove him after a little he appoints eleazer the son of ananus the high priest to the same office and have remove him also at the end of a year he give the high priesthood to simon the son of camithus but he likewise held the honor no more than a year when josephus call also caiaphas succeed him accordingly the whole time of our savior ministry be show to have be not quite four full year four high priest from anna to the accession of caiaphas have held office a year each the gospel therefore have rightly indicate caiaphas a the high priest under whom the savior suffer from which also we can see that the time of our savior ministry do not disagree with the forego investigation our savior and lord not long after the begin of his ministry call the twelve apostle and these alone of all his disciple he name apostle a an especial honor and again he appoint seventy others whom he sent out two by two before his face into every place and city whither he himself be about to come chapter testimony in regard to john the baptist and christ not long after this john the baptist be behead by the young herod a be state in the gospel josephus also record the same fact make mention of herodias by name and state that although she be the wife of his brother herod make her his own wife after divorce his former lawful wife who be the daughter of aretas king of petra and separate herodias from her husband while he be still alive it be on her account also that he slew john and wag war with aretas because of the disgrace inflict on the daughter of the latter josephus relates that in this war when they come to battle herod entire army be destroyed and that he suffer this calamity on account of his crime against john the same josephus confesses in this account that john the baptist be an exceedingly righteous man and thus agrees with the thing write of him in the gospel he record also that herod lose his kingdom on account of the same herodias and that he be driven into banishment with her and condemn to live at vienne in gaul he relates these thing in the eighteenth book of the antiquity where he writes of john in the follow word it seem to some of the jew that the army of herod be destroyed by god who most justly avenge john call the baptist for herod slew him a good man and one who exhort the jew to come and receive baptism practice virtue and exercise righteousness toward each other and toward god for baptism would appear acceptable unto him when they employ it not for the remission of certain sin but for the purification of the body a the soul have be already purify in righteousness and when others gather about him for they found much pleasure in listen to his word herod fear that his great influence might lead to some sedition for they appear ready to do whatever he might advise he therefore consider it much well before any new thing should be do under john influence to anticipate it by slay him than to repent after revolution have come and when he found himself in the midst of difficulty on account of herod suspicion john be sent in bond to the abovementioned citadel of machaera and there slain after relate these thing concern john he make mention of our savior in the same work in the follow word and there live at that time jesus a wise man if indeed it be proper to call him a man for he be a doer of wonderful work and a teacher of such men a receive the truth in gladness and he attach to himself many of the jew and many also of the greek he be the christ when pilate on the accusation of our principal men condemn him to the cross those who have love him in the begin do not cease love him for he appear unto them again alive on the third day the divine prophet have told these and countless other wonderful thing concern him moreover the race of christian name after him continue down to the present day since an historian who be one of the hebrew themselves have record in his work these thing concern john the baptist and our savior what excuse be there left for not convict them of be destitute of all shame who have forge the act against them but let this suffice here chapter the disciple of our savior the name of the apostle of our savior be know to every one from the gospel but there exists no catalogue of the seventy disciple barnabas indeed be say to have be one of them of whom the act of the apostle make mention in various place and especially paul in his epistle to the galatian they say that sosthenes also who write to the corinthian with paul be one of them this be the account of clement in the fifth book of his hypotyposes in which he also say that cephas be one of the seventy disciple a man who bore the same name a the apostle peter and the one concern whom paul say when cephas come to antioch i withstood him to his face matthias also who be numbered with the apostle in the place of juda and the one who be honor by be make a candidate with him be likewise say to have be deem worthy of the same call with the seventy they say that thaddeus also be one of them concern whom i shall presently relate an account which have come down to u and upon examination you will find that our savior have more than seventy disciple accord to the testimony of paul who say that after his resurrection from the dead he appear first to cephas then to the twelve and after them to above five hundred brother at once of whom some have fall asleep but the majority be still living at the time he write afterwards he say he appear unto james who be one of the socalled brother of the savior but since in addition to these there be many others who be call apostle in imitation of the twelve a be paul himself he add afterward he appear to all the apostle so much in regard to these person but the story concern thaddeus be a follow chapter narrative concern the prince of the edessences the divinity of our lord and savior jesus christ be noise abroad among all men on account of his wonderworking power he attract countless number from foreign country lie far away from judea who have the opening of be cure of their disease and of all kind of suffering for instance the king abgarus who rule with great glory the nation beyond the euphrates be afflict with a terrible disease which it be beyond the power of human skill to cure when he heard of the name of jesus and of his miracle which be attest by all with one accord sent a message to him by a courier and beg him to heal his disease but he do not at that time comply with his request yet he deem him worthy of a personal letter in which he say that he would send one of his disciple to cure his disease and at the same time promise salvation to himself and all his house not long afterward his promise be fulfil for after his resurrection from the dead and his ascent into heaven thomas one of the twelve apostle under divine impulse sent thaddeus who be also numbered among the seventy disciple of christ to edessa a a preacher and evangelist of the teach of christ and all that our savior have promise receive through him it fulfillment you have write evidence of these thing take from the archive of edessa which be at that time a royal city for in the public register there which contain account of ancient time and the act of abgarus these thing have be found preserve down to the present time but there be no well way than to hear the epistle themselves which we have take from the archive and have literally translate from the syriac language in the follow manner copy of an epistle write by abgarus the ruler to jesus tend sent to him at jerusalem by ananias the swift courier abgarus ruler of edessa to jesus the excellent savior who have appear in the country of jerusalem greet i have heard the report of thee and of thy cure a perform by thee without medicine or herb for it be say that thou makest the blind to see and the lame to walk that thou cleansest leper and castest out impure spirit and demon and that thou healest those afflict with linger disease and raisest the dead and have heard all these thing concern thee i have conclude that one of two thing must be true either thou art god and have come down from heaven thou doest these thing or else thou who doest these thing art the son of god i have therefore write to thee to ask thee that thou wouldest take the trouble to come to me and heal the disease which i have for i have heard that the jew be murmur against thee and be plot to injure thee but i have a very small yet noble city which be great enough for u both the answer of jesus to the ruler abgarus by the courier ananias bless art thou who hast believe in me without have see me for it be write concern me that they who have see me will not believe in me and that they who have not see me will believe and be save but in regard to what thou hast write me that i should come to thee it be necessary for me to fulfill all thing here for which i have be sent and after i have fulfil them thus to be take up again to him that sent me but after i have be take up i will send to thee one of my disciple that he may heal thy disease and give life to thee and thine to these epistle there be add the follow account in the syriac language after the ascension of jesus juda who be also call thomas sent to him thaddeus an apostle one of the seventy when he be come he lodge with tobias the son of tobias when the report of him get abroad it be told abgarus that an apostle of jesus be come a he have write him thaddeus begin then in the power of god to heal every disease and infirmity insomuch that all wonder and when abgarus heard of the great and wonderful thing which he do and of the cure which he perform he begin to suspect that he be the one of whom jesus have write him say after i have be take up i will send to thee one of my disciple who will heal thee therefore summon tobias with whom thaddeus lodge he say i have heard that a certain man of power have come and be lodge in thy house bring him to me and tobias come to thaddeus say to him the ruler abgarus summon me and told me to bring thee to him that thou mightest heal him and thaddeus say i will go for i have be sent to him with power tobias therefore arose early on the follow day and take thaddeus come to abgarus and when he come the noble be present and stood about abgarus and immediately upon his entrance a great vision appear to abgarus in the countenance of the apostle thaddeus when abgarus saw it he prostrate himself before thaddeus while all those who stood about be astonish for they do not see the vision which appear to abgarus alone he then ask thaddeus if he be in truth a disciple of jesus the son of god who have say to him i will send thee one of my disciple who shall heal thee and give thee life and thaddeus say because thou hast mightily believe in him that sent me therefore have i be sent unto thee and still far if thou believest in him the petition of thy heart shall be grant thee a thou believest and abgarus say to him so much have i believe in him that i wish to take an army and destroy those jew who crucify him have i not be deter from it by reason of the dominion of the roman and thaddeus say our lord have fulfil the will of his father and have fulfil it have be take up to his father and abgarus say to him i too have believe in him and in his father and thaddeus say to him therefore i place my hand upon thee in his name and when he have do it immediately abgarus be cure of the disease and of the suffer which he have and abgarus marvel that a he have heard concern jesus so he have receive in very deed through his disciple thaddeus who heal him without medicine and herb and not only him but also abdus the son of abdus who be afflict with the gout for he too come to him and fell at his foot and have receive a benediction by the imposition of his hand he be heal the same thaddeus cure also many other inhabitant of the city and do wonder and marvelous work and preach the word of god and afterward abgarus say thou o thaddeus doest these thing with the power of god and we marvel but in addition to these thing i pray thee to inform me in regard to the come of jesus how he be born and in regard to his power by what power he perform those deed of which i have heard and thaddeus say now indeed will i keep silence since i have be sent to proclaim the word publicly but tomorrow assemble for me all thy citizen and i will preach in their presence and sow among them the word of god concern the come of jesus how he be born and concern his mission for what purpose he be sent by the father and concern the power of his work and the mystery which he proclaim in the world and by what power he do these thing and concern his new preach and his abasement and humiliation and how he humble himself and die and debase his divinity and be crucify and descend into hades and burst the bar which from eternity have not be broken and raise the dead for he descend alone but rise with many and thus ascend to his father abgarus therefore command the citizen to assemble early in the morning to hear the preach of thaddeus and afterward he order gold and silver to be give him but he refuse to take it say if we have forsaken that which be our own how shall we take that which be anothers these thing be do in the three hundred and fortieth year i have insert them here in their proper place translate from the syriac literally and i hope to good purpose book ii introduction we have discuss in the precede book those subject in ecclesiastical history which it be necessary to treat by way of introduction and have accompany them with brief proof such be the divinity of the save word and the antiquity of the doctrine which we teach a well a of that evangelical life which be lead by christian together with the event which have take place in connection with christ recent appearance and in connection with his passion and with the choice of the apostle in the present book let u examine the event which take place after his ascension confirm some of them from the divine scripture and others from such writing a we shall refer to from time to time chapter the course pursue by the apostle after the ascension of christ first then in the place of juda the betrayer matthias who a have be show be also one of the seventy be chosen to the apostolate and there be appoint to the diaconate for the service of the congregation by prayer and the lay on of the hand of the apostle approve men seven in number of whom stephen be one he first after the lord be stone to death at the time of his ordination by the slayer of the lord a if he have be promote for this very purpose and thus he be the first to receive the crown correspond to his name which belongs to the martyr of christ who be worthy of the meed of victory then james whom the ancient surnamed the just on account of the excellence of his virtue be record to have be the first to be make bishop of the church of jerusalem this james be call the brother of the lord because he be know a a son of joseph and joseph be suppose to be the father of christ because the virgin be betroth to him be found with child by the holy ghost before they come together a the account of the holy gospel show but clement in the sixth book of his hypotyposes writes thus for they say that peter and james and john after the ascension of our savior a if also prefer by our lord strove not after honor but chose james the just bishop of jerusalem but the same writer in the seventh book of the same work relates also the follow thing concern him the lord after his resurrection impart knowledge to james the just and to john and peter and they impart it to the rest of the apostle and the rest of the apostle to the seventy of whom barnabas be one but there be two james one call the just who be thrown from the pinnacle of the temple and be beaten to death with a club by a fuller and another who be behead paul also make mention of the same james the just where he writes other of the apostle saw i none save james the lord brother at that time also the promise of our savior to the king of the osrhoenians be fulfil for thomas under a divine impulse sent thaddeus to edessa a a preacher and evangelist of the religion of christ a we have show a little above from the document found there when he come to that place he heal abgarus by the word of christ and after bring all the people there into the right attitude of mind by mean of his work and lead them to adore the power of christ he make them disciple of the savior teach and from that time down to the present the whole city of the edessenes have be devote to the name of christ offering no common proof of the beneficence of our savior toward them also these thing have be drawn from ancient account but let u now turn again to the divine scripture when the first and great persecution be instigate by the jew against the church of jerusalem in connection with the martyrdom of stephen and when all the disciple except the twelve be scatter throughout judea and samaria some a the divine scripture say go a far a phoenicia and cyprus and antioch but could not yet venture to impart the word of faith to the nation and therefore preach it to the jew alone during this time paul be still persecute the church and enter the house of believer be drag men and woman away and commit them to prison philip also one of those who with stephen have be entrust with the diaconate be among those who be scatter abroad go down to samaria and be fill with the divine power he first preach the word to the inhabitant of that country and divine grace work so mightily with him that even simon magus with many others be attract by his word simon be at that time so celebrate and have acquire by his jugglery such influence over those who be deceive by him that he be thought to be the great power of god but at this time be amaze at the wonderful deed wrought by philip through the divine power he reign and counterfeit faith in christ even go so far a to receive baptism and what be surprising the same thing be do even to this day by those who follow his most impure heresy for they after the manner of their forefather slip into the church like a pestilential and leprous disease greatly afflict those into whom they be able to infuse the deadly and terrible poison conceal in themselves the most of these have be expel a soon a they have be caught in their wickedness a simon himself when detect by peter receive the merit punishment but a the preach of the savior gospel be daily advance a certain providence lead from the land of the ethiopian an officer of the queen of that country for ethiopia even to the present day be rule accord to ancestral custom by a woman he first among the gentile receive of the mystery of the divine word from philip in consequence of a revelation and have become the firstfruits of believer throughout the world he be say to have be the first on return to his country to proclaim the knowledge of the god of the universe and the lifegiving sojourn of our savior among men so that through him in truth the prophecy obtain it fulfillment which declares that ethiopia stretcheth out her hand unto god in addition to these paul that chosen vessel not of men neither through men but by the revelation of jesus christ himself and of god the father who raise him from the dead be appoint an apostle be make worthy of the call by a vision and by a voice which be uttered in a revelation from heaven chapter how tiberius be affected when inform by pilate concern christ and when the wonderful resurrection and ascension of our savior be already noise abroad in accordance with an ancient custom which prevail among the ruler of the province of reporting to the emperor the novel occurrence which take place in them in order that nothing might escape him pontius pilate inform tiberius of the report which be noise abroad through all palestine concern the resurrection of our savior jesus from the dead he give an account also of other wonder which he have learn of him and how after his death have risen from the dead he be now believe by many to be a god they say that tiberius refer the matter to the senate but that they reject it ostensibly because they have not first examine into the matter for an ancient law prevail that no one should be make a god by the roman except by a vote and decree of the senate but in reality because the save teach of the divine gospel do not need the confirmation and recommendation of men but although the senate of the roman reject the proposition make in regard to our savior tiberius still retain the opinion which he have held at first and contrive no hostile measure against christ these thing be record by tertullian a man well verse in the law of the roman and in other respect of high repute and one of those especially distinguish in rome in his apology for the christian which be write by him in the latin language and have be translate into greek he writes a follow but in order that we may give an account of these law from their origin it be an ancient decree n that no one should be consecrate a god by the emperor until the senate have express it approval marcus aurelius do thus concern a certain idol alburnus and this be a point in favor of our doctrine that among you divine dignity be confer by human decree if a god do not please a man he be not make a god thus accord to this custom it be necessary for man to be gracious to god tiberius therefore under whom the name of christ make it entry into the world when this doctrine be report to him from palestine where it first begin communicate with the senate make it clear to them that he be pleased with the doctrine but the senate since it have not itself prove the matter reject it but tiberius continued to hold his own opinion and threaten death to the accuser of the christian heavenly providence have wisely instill this into his mind in order that the doctrine of the gospel unhindered at it begin might spread in all direction throughout the world chapter the doctrine of christ soon spread throughout all the world thus under the influence of heavenly power and with the divine cooperation the doctrine of the savior like the ray of the sun quickly illumine the whole world and straightway in accordance with the divine scripture the voice of the inspire evangelist and apostle go forth through all the earth and their word to the end of the world in every city and village church be quickly establish fill with multitude of people like a replenish threshingfloor and those whose mind in consequence of error which have descend to them from their forefather be fetter by the ancient disease of idolatrous superstition be by the power of christ operating through the teach and the wonderful work of his disciple set free a it be from terrible master and found a release from the most cruel bondage they renounce with abhorrence every specie of demoniacal polytheism and confess that there be only one god the creator of all thing and him they honor with the rite of true piety through the inspire and rational worship which have be plant by our savior among men but the divine grace be now pour out upon the rest of the nation cornelius of caesarea in palestine with his whole house through a divine revelation and the agency of peter first receive faith in christ and after him a multitude of other greek in antioch to whom those who be scatter by the persecution of stephen have preach the gospel when the church of antioch be now increase and abound and a multitude of prophet from jerusalem be on the ground among them barnabas and paul and in addition many other brother the name of christian first sprang up there a from a fresh and lifegiving fountainand agabus one of the prophet who be with them uttered a prophecy concern the famine which be about to take place and paul and barnabas be sent to relieve the necessity of the brother chapter after the death of tiberius caius appoint agrippa king of the jew have punish herod with perpetual exile tiberius die after have reign about twentytwo year and caius succeed him in the empire he immediately give the government of the jew to agrippa make him king over the tetrarchies of philip and of lysanias in addition to which he bestow upon him not long afterward the tetrarchy of herod have punish herod the one under whom the savior suffer and his wife herodias with perpetual exile on account of numerous crime josephus be a witness to these fact under this emperor philo become know a man most celebrate not only among many of our own but also among many scholar without the church he be a hebrew by birth but be inferior to none of those who held high dignity in alexandria how exceedingly he labor in the scripture and in the study of his nation be plain to all from the work which he have do how familiar he be with philosophy and with the liberal study of foreign nation it be not necessary to say since he be report to have surpass all his contemporary in the study of platonic and pythagorean philosophy to which he particularly devote his attention chapter philos embassy to caius in behalf of the jew philo have give u an account in five book of the misfortune of the jew under caius he recount at the same time the madness of caius how he call himself a god and perform a emperor innumerable act of tyranny and he describes far the misery of the jew under him and give a report of the embassy upon which he himself be sent to rome in behalf of his fellowcountrymen in alexandria how when he appear before caius in behalf of the law of his father he receive nothing but laughter and ridicule and almost incur the risk of his life josephus also make mention of these thing in the eighteenth book of his antiquity in the follow word a a sedition have arisen in alexandria between the jew that dwell there and the greek three deputy be chosen from each faction and go to caius one of the alexandrian deputy be apion who uttered many slander against the jew among other thing say that they neglect the honor due to caesar for while all other subject of rome erect altar and temple to caius and in all other respect treat him just a they do the god they alone consider it disgraceful to honor him with statue and to swear by his name and when apion have uttered many severe charge by which he hop that caius would be arouse a indeed be likely philo the chief of the jewish embassy a man celebrate in every respect a brother of alexander the alabarch and not unskilled in philosophy be prepared to enter upon a defense in reply to his accusation but caius prevent him and order him to leave and be very angry it be plain that he meditate some severe measure against them and philo depart cover with insult and told the jew that be with him to be of good courage for while caius be rag against them he be in fact already contend with god thus far josephus and philo himself in the work on the embassy which he write describes accurately and in detail the thing which be do by him at that time but i shall omit the most of them and record only those thing which will make clearly evident to the reader that the misfortune of the jew come upon them not long after their dare deed against christ and on account of the same and in the first place he relates that at rome in the reign of tiberius sejanus who at that time enjoy great influence with the emperor make every effort to destroy the jewish nation utterly and that in judea pilate under whom the crime against the savior be commit attempt something contrary to the jewish law in respect to the temple which be at that time still stand in jerusalem and excite them to the great tumult chapter the misfortune which overwhelmed the jew after their presumption against christ after the death of tiberius caius receive the empire and besides innumerable other act of tyranny against many people he greatly afflict especially the whole nation of the jew these thing we may learn briefly from the word of philo who writes a follow so great be the caprice of caius in his conduct toward all and especially toward the nation of the jew the latter he so bitterly hat that he appropriate to himself their place of worship in the other city and begin with alexandria he fill them with image and statue of himself for in permit others to erect them he really erect them himself the temple in the holy city which have hitherto be left untouched and have be regard a an inviolable asylum he alter and transform into a temple of his own that it might be call the temple of the visible jupiter the young caius innumerable other terrible and almost indescribable calamity which come upon the jew in alexandria during the reign of the same emperor be record by the same author in a second work to which he give the title on the virtue with him agrees also josephus who likewise indicates that the misfortune of the whole nation begin with the time of pilate and with their dare crime against the savior hear what be say in the second book of his jewish war where he writes a follow pilate be sent to judea a procurator by tiberius secretly carry veil image of the emperor call ensign to jerusalem by night the follow day this cause the great disturbance among the jew for those who be near be confound at the sight beholding their law a it be trample under foot for they allow no image to be set up in their city compare these thing with the writing of the evangelist you will see that it be not long before there come upon them the penalty for the exclamation which they have uttered under the same pilate when they cry out that they have no other king than caesar the same writer far record that after this another calamity overtook them he writes a follow after this he stir up another tumult by snake use of the holy treasure which be call corban in the construction of an aqueduct three hundred stadium in length the multitude be greatly displeased at it and when pilate be in jerusalem they surround his tribunal and give utterance to loud complaint but he anticipate the tumult have distribute through the crowd arm soldier disguise in citizen clothing forbid them to use the sword but command them to strike with club those who should make an outcry to them he now give the preconcerted signal from the tribunal and the jew be beaten many of them perish in consequence of the blow while many others be trample under foot by their own countryman in their flight and thus lose their life but the multitude overawe by the fate of those who be slain held their peace in addition to these the same author record many other tumult which be stir up in jerusalem itself and show that from that time sedition and war and mischievous plot follow each other in quick succession and never cease in the city and in all judea until finally the siege of vespasian overwhelmed them thus the divine vengeance overtook the jew for the crime which they dare to commit against christ chapter pilate suicide it be worthy of note that pilate himself who be governor in the time of our savior be report to have fall into such misfortune under caius whose time we be record that he be force to become his own murderer and executioner and thus divine vengeance a it seem be not long in overtake him this be state by those greek historian who have record the olympiad together with the respective event which have take place in each period chapter the famine which take place in the reign of claudius caius have held the power not quite four year when he be succeed by the emperor claudius under him the world be visit with a famine which writer that be entire stranger to our religion have record in their history and thus the prediction of agabus record in the act of the apostle accord to which the whole world be to be visit by a famine receive it fulfillment and luke in the act after mention the famine in the time of claudius and state that the brother of antioch each accord to his ability sent to the brother of judea by the hand of paul and barnabas add the follow account chapter the martyrdom of james the apostle now about that time it be clear that he mean the time of claudius herod the king stretch forth his hand to vex certain of the church and he kill james the brother of john with the sword and concern this james clement in the seventh book of his hypotyposes relates a story which be worthy of mention tell it a he receive it from those who have live before him he say that the one who lead james to the judgmentseat when he saw him bearing his testimony be move and confess that he be himself also a christian they be both therefore he say lead away together and on the way he beg james to forgive him and he after consider a little say peace be with thee and kiss him and thus they be both behead at the same time and then a the divine scripture say herod upon the death of james see that the deed pleased the jew attack peter also and commit him to prison and would have slain him if he have not by the divine appearance of an angel who come to him by night be wonderfully release from his bond and thus liberate for the service of the gospel such be the providence of god in respect to peter chapter agrippa who be also call herod have persecute the apostle immediately experienced the divine vengeance the consequence of the king undertaking against the apostle be no long defer but the avenge minister of divine justice overtook him immediately after his plot against them a the book of act record for when he have journeyed to caesarea on a notable feastday clothed in a splendid and royal garment he deliver an address to the people from a lofty throne in front of the tribunal and when all the multitude applaud the speech a if it be the voice of a god and not of a man the scripture relates that an angel of the lord smote him and be eat of worm he give up the ghost we must admire the account of josephus for it agreement with the divine scripture in regard to this wonderful event for he clearly bear witness to the truth in the nineteenth book of his antiquity where he relates the wonder in the follow word he have complete the third year of his reign over all judea when he come to caesarea which be formerly call stratos tower there he held game in honor of caesar learn that this be a festival observe in behalf of caesar safety at this festival be collect a great multitude of the high and most honorable men in the province and on the second day of the game he proceed to the theater at break of day wear a garment entirely of silver and of wonderful texture and there the silver illuminate by the reflection of the sun early ray shone marvelously gleam so brightly a to produce a sort of fear and terror in those who gaze upon him and immediately his flatterer some from one place others from another raise up their voice in a way that be not for his good call him a god and say be thou merciful if up to this time we have fear thee a a man henceforth we confess that thou art superior to the nature of mortal the king do not rebuke them nor do he reject their impious flattery but after a little look up he saw an angel sit above his head and this he quickly perceive would be the cause of evil a it have once be the cause of good fortune and he be smitten with a heartpiercing pain and straightway distress begin with the great violence seize his bowel and look upon his friend he say i your god be now command to depart this life and fate thus i on the spot disproves the lie word you have just uttered concern me he who have be call immortal by you be now lead away to die but our destiny must be accepted a god have determine it for we have pass our life by no mean ingloriously but in that splendor which be pronounce happiness and when he have say this he labor with an increase of pain he be accordingly carry in haste to the palace while the report spread among all that the king would undoubtedly soon die but the multitude with their wife and child sit on sackcloth after the custom of their father implore god in behalf of the king and every place be fill with lamentation and tear and the king a he lay in a lofty chamber and saw them below lie prostrate on the ground could not refrain from weep himself and after suffer continually for five day with pain in the bowel he depart this life in the fiftyfourth year of his age and in the seventh year of his reign four year he rule under the emperor caius three of them over the tetrarchy of philip to which be add in the fourth year that of herod and three year during the reign of the emperor claudius i marvel greatly that josephus in these thing a well a in others so fully agrees with the divine scripture but if there should seem to any one to be a disagreement in respect to the name of the king the time at least and the event show that the same person be meant whether the change of name have be cause by the error of a copyist or be due to the fact that he like so many bore two name chapter the impostor theudas and his follower luke in the act introduces gamaliel a say at the consultation which be held concern the apostle that at the time refer to rise up theudas boasting himself to be somebody who be slain and all a many a obeyed him be scatter let u therefore add the account of josephus concern this man he record in the work mention just above the follow circumstance while fadus be procurator of judea a certain impostor call theudas persuade a very great multitude to take their possession and follow him to the river jordan for he say that he be a prophet and that the river should be divide at his command and afford them an easy passage and with these word he deceive many but fadus do not permit them to enjoy their folly but sent a troop of horseman against them who fell upon them unexpectedly and slew many of them and take many others alive while they take theudas himself captive and cut off his head and carry it to jerusalem besides this he also make mention of the famine which take place in the reign of claudius in the follow word chapter helen the queen of the osrhoenians and at this time it come to pas that the great famine a take place in judea in which the queen helen have purchase grain from egypt with large sum distribute it to the needy you will find this statement also in agreement with the act of the apostle where it be say that the disciple at antioch each accord to his ability determine to send relief to the brother that dwelt in judea which also they do and sent it to the elder by the hand of barnabas and paul but splendid monument of this helen of whom the historian have make mention be still show in the suburb of the city which be now call aelia but she be say to have be queen of the adiabeni chapter simon magus but faith in our savior and lord jesus christ have now be diffuse among all men the enemy of man salvation contrive a plan for seize the imperial city for himself he conduct thither the abovementioned simon aid him in his deceitful art lead many of the inhabitant of rome astray and thus brought them into his own power this be state by justin one of our distinguish writer who live not long after the time of the apostle concern him i shall speak in the proper place take and read the work of this man who in the first apology which he address to antonine in behalf of our religion writes a follow and after the ascension of the lord into heaven the demon put forward certain men who say they be god and who be not only allow by you to go unpersecuted but be even deem worthy of honor one of them be simon a samaritan of the village of gitto who in the reign of claudius caesar perform in your imperial city some mighty act of magic by the art of demon operating in him and be consider a god and a a god be honor by you with a statue which be erect in the river tiber between the two bridge and bore this inscription in the latin tongue simoni deo sancto that be to simon the holy god and nearly all the samaritan and a few even of other nation confess and worship him a the first god and there go around with him at that time a certain helena who have formerly be a prostitute in tyre of phoenicia and her they call the first idea that proceed from him justin relates these thing and irenaeus also agrees with him in the first book of his work against heresy where he give an account of the man and of his profane and impure teach it would be superfluous to quote his account here for it be possible for those who wish to know the origin and the life and the false doctrine of each of the heresiarchs that have follow him a well a the custom practice by them all to find them treat at length in the abovementioned work of irenaeus we have understood that simon be the author of all heresy from his time down to the present those who have follow his heresy have reign the sober philosophy of the christian which be celebrate among all on account of it purity of life but they nevertheless have embrace again the superstition of idol which they seem to have renounce and they fall down before picture and image of simon himself and of the abovementioned helena who be with him and they venture to worship them with incense and sacrifice and libation but those matter which they keep more secret than these in regard to which they say that one upon first hearing them would be astonish and to use one of the write phrase in vogue among them would be confound be in truth full of amaze thing and of madness and folly be of such a sort that it be impossible not only to commit them to write but also for modest men even to utter them with the lip on account of their excessive baseness and lewdness for what ever could be conceive of viler than the vilest thing all that have be outdone by this most abominable sect which be compose of those who make a sport of those miserable female that be literally overwhelmed with all kind of vice chapter the preach of the apostle peter in rome the evil power who hate all that be good and plot against the salvation of men constitute simon at that time the father and author of such wickedness a if to make him a mighty antagonist of the great inspire apostle of our savior for that divine and celestial grace which cooperates with it minister by their appearance and presence quickly extinguish the kindle flame of evil and humble and cast down through them every high thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of god wherefore neither the conspiracy of simon nor that of any of the others who arose at that period could accomplish anything in those apostolic time for everything be conquer and subdue by the splendor of the truth and by the divine word itself which have but lately begin to shine from heaven upon men and which be then flourish upon earth and dwell in the apostle themselves immediately the abovementioned impostor be smitten in the eye of his mind by a divine and miraculous flash and after the evil deed do by him have be first detect by the apostle peter in judea he flee and make a great journey across the sea from the east to the west think that only thus could he live accord to his mind and come to the city of rome by the mighty cooperation of that power which be lie in wait there he be in a short time so successful in his undertaking that those who dwelt there honor him a a god by the erection of a statue but this do not last long for immediately during the reign of claudius the allgood and gracious providence which watch over all thing lead peter that strong and great of the apostle and the one who on account of his virtue be the speaker for all the others to rome s against this great corrupter of life he like a noble commander of god clad in divine armor carry the costly merchandise of the light of the understand from the east to those who dwelt in the west proclaim the light itself and the word which brings salvation to soul and preach the kingdom of heaven chapter the gospel accord to mark and thus when the divine word have make it home among them the power of simon be quenched and immediately destroyed together with the man himself and so greatly do the splendor of piety illumine the mind of peter hearer that they be not satisfied with hearing once only and be not content with the unwritten teach of the divine gospel but with all sort of entreaty they besought mark a follower of peter and the one whose gospel be extant that he would leave them a write monument of the doctrine which have be orally communicate to them nor do they cease until they have prevail with the man and have thus become the occasion of the write gospel which bear the name of mark and they say that peter when he have learn through a revelation of the spirit of that which have be do be pleased with the zeal of the men and that the work obtain the sanction of his authority for the purpose of be use in the church clement in the eighth book of his hypotyposes give this account and with him agrees the bishop of hierapolis name papias and peter make mention of mark in his first epistle which they say that he write in rome itself a be indicate by him when he call the city by a figure babylon a he do in the follow word the church that be at babylon elect together with you saluteth you and so doth marcus my son chapter mark first proclaim christianity to the inhabitant of egypt and they say that this mark be the first that be sent to egypt and that he proclaim the gospel which he have write and first establish church in alexandria and the multitude of believer both men and woman that be collect there at the very outset and live life of the most philosophical and excessive asceticism be so great that philo thought it worth while to describe their pursuit their meeting their entertainment and their whole manner of life chapter philos account of the ascetic of egypt it be also say that philo in the reign of claudius become acquaint at rome with peter who be then preach there nor be this indeed improbable for the work of which we have spoken and which be compose by him some year later clearly contains those rule of the church which be even to this day observe among u and since he describes a accurately a possible the life of our ascetic it be clear that he not only knew but that he also approve while he venerate and extol the apostolic men of his time who be a it seem of the hebrew race and hence observe after the manner of the jew the most of the custom of the ancient in the work to which he give the title on a contemplative life or on suppliant after affirm in the first place that he will add to those thing which he be about to relate nothing contrary to truth or of his own invention he say that these men be call therapeut and the woman that be with them therapeutrides he then add the reason for such a name explain it from the fact that they apply remedy and heal the soul of those who come to them by relieve them like physician of evil passion or from the fact that they serve and worship the deity in purity and sincerity whether philo himself give them this name employ an epithet well suit to their mode of life or whether the first of them really call themselves so in the begin since the name of christian be not yet everywhere know we need not discus here he bear witness however that first of all they renounce their property when they begin the philosophical mode of life he say they give up their good to their relative and then renounce all the care of life they go forth beyond the wall and dwell in lonely field and garden know well that intercourse with people of a different character be unprofitable and harmful they do this at that time a seem probable under the influence of a spirit and ardent faith practice in emulation the prophet mode of life for in the act of the apostle a work universally acknowledge a authentic it be record that all the companion of the apostle sell their possession and their property and distribute to all accord to the necessity of each one so that no one among them be in want for a many a be possessor of land or house a the account say sell them and brought the price of the thing that be sell and laid them at the apostle foot so that distribution be make unto every man accord a he have need philo bear witness to fact very much like those here described and then add the follow account everywhere in the world be this race found for it be fitting that both greek and barbarian should share in what be perfectly good but the race particularly abounds in egypt in each of it socalled nome and especially about alexandria the best men from every quarter emigrate a if to a colony of the therapeuts fatherland to a certain very suitable spot which lie above the lake maria upon a low hill excellently situate on account of it security and the mildness of the atmosphere and then a little far on after describe the kind of house which they have he speaks a follow concern their church which be scatter about here and there in each house there be a sacred apartment which be call a sanctuary and monastery where quite alone they perform the mystery of the religious life they bring nothing into it neither drink nor food nor any of the other thing which contribute to the necessity of the body but only the law and the inspire oracle of the prophet and hymn and such other thing a augment and make perfect their knowledge and piety and after some other matter he saysthe whole interval from morning to even be for them a time of exercise for they read the holy scripture and explain the philosophy of their father in an allegorical manner regard the write word a symbol of hidden truth which be communicate in obscure figure they have also writing of ancient men who be the founder of their sect and who left many monument of the allegorical method these they use a model and imitate their principle these thing seem to have be state by a man who have heard them expound their sacred writing but it be highly probable that the work of the ancient which he say they have be the gospel and the writing of the apostle and probably some exposition of the ancient prophet such a be contain in the epistle to the hebrew and in many others of paul epistle then again he writes a follow concern the new psalm which they compose so that they not only spend their time in meditation but they also compose song and hymn to god in every variety of meter and melody though they divide them of course into measure of more than common solemnity the same book contains an account of many other thing but it seem necessary to select those fact which exhibit the characteristic of the ecclesiastical mode of life but if any one think that what have be say be not peculiar to the gospel polity but that it can be apply to others besides those mention let him be convince by the subsequent word of the same author in which if he be unprejudiced he will find undisputed testimony on this subject philos word be a follow have laid down temperance a a sort of foundation in the soul they build upon it the other virtue none of them may take food or drink before sunset since they regard philosophize a a work worthy of the light but attention to the want of the body a proper only in the darkness and therefore assign the day to the former but to the latter a small portion of the night but some in whom a great desire for knowledge dwells forget to take food for three day and some be so delighted and feast so luxuriously upon wisdom which furnishes doctrine richly and without stint that they abstain even twice a long a this and be accustom after six day scarcely to take necessary food these statement of philo we regard a refer clearly and indisputably to those of our communion but if after these thing any one still obstinately persists in deny the reference let him renounce his incredulity and be convince by yet more strike example which be to be found nowhere else than in the evangelical religion of the christian for they say that there be woman also with those of whom we be speak and that the most of them be age virgin who have preserve their chastity not out of necessity a some of the priestess among the greek but rather by their own choice through zeal and a desire for wisdom and that in their earnest desire to live with it a their companion they paid no attention to the pleasure of the body seek not mortal but immortal progeny which only the pious soul be able to bear of itself then after a little he add still more emphatically they expound the sacred scripture figuratively by mean of allegory for the whole law seem to these men to resemble a living organism of which the spoken word constitute the body while the hidden sense store up within the word constitutes the soul this hidden meaning have first be particularly study by this sect which see reveal a in a mirror of name the surpass beauty of the thought why be it necessary to add to these thing their meeting and the respective occupation of the men and of the woman during those meeting and the practice which be even to the present day habitually observe by u especially such a we be accustom to observe at the feast of the savior passion with fast and night watch and study of the divine word these thing the abovementioned author have related in his own work indicate a mode of life which have be preserve to the present time by u alone record especially the vigil kept in connection with the great festival and the exercise perform during those vigil and the hymn customarily recite by u and describe how while one sings regularly in time the others listen in silence and join in chant only the close of the hymn and how on the day refer to they sleep on the ground on bed of straw and to use his own word taste no wine at all nor any flesh but water be their only drink and there dish with their bread be salt and hyssop in addition to this philo describes the order of dignity which sits among those who carry on the service of the church mention the diaconate and the office of bishop which take the precedence over all the others but whosoever desire a more accurate knowledge of these matter may get it from the history already cite but that philo when he write these thing have in view the first herald of the gospel and the custom hand down from the begin by the apostle be clear to every one chapter the work of philo that have come down to u copious in language comprehensive in i thought sublime and elevate in his view of divine scripture philo have produce manifold and various exposition of the sacred book on the one hand he expounds in order the event record in genesis in the book to which he give the title allegory of the sacred law on the other hand he make successive divisionsof the chapter in the scripture which be the subject of investigation and give objection and solution in the book which he quite suitably call question and answer an genesis and exodus there be besides these treatise expressly work out by him on certain subject such a the two book on agriculture and the same number on drunkenness and some others distinguish by different title correspond to the content of each for instance concern the thing which the sober mind desire and execrates on the confusion of tongue on flight and discovery on assembly for the sake of instruction on the question who be heir to thing divine or on the division of thing into equal and unequal and still far the work on the three virtue which with others have be described by moses in addition to these be the work on those whose name have be change and why they have be change in which he say that he have write also two book on covenant and there be also a work of his on emigration and one on the life of a wise man make perfect in righteousness or on unwritten law and still far the work on giant or on the immutability of god and a first second third fourth and fifth book on the proposition that dream accord to moses be sent by god these be the book on genesis that have come down to u but on exodus we be acquaint with the first second third fourth and fifth book of question and answer also with that on the tabernacle and that on the ten commandment and the four book on the law which refer especially to the principal division of the ten commandment and another on animal intend for sacrifice and on the kind of sacrifice and another on the reward fix in the law for the good and on the punishment and curse fix for the wicked in addition to all these there be extant also some singlevolumed work of his a for instance the work on providence and the book compose by him on the jew and the statesman and still far alexander or on the possession of reason by the irrational animal besides these there be a work on the proposition that every wicked man be a slave to which be subjoin the work on the proposition that every good man be free after these be compose by him the work on the contemplative life or on suppliant from which we have drawn the fact concern the life of the apostolic men and still far the interpretation of the hebrew name in the law and in the prophet be say to be the result of his industry and he be say to have read in the presence of the whole roman senate during the reign of claudius the work which he have write when he come to rome under coin concern coin hatred of the god and to which with ironical reference to it character he have give the title on the virtue and his discourse be so much admire a to be deem worthy of a place in the library at this time while paul be complete his journey from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum claudius drove the jew out of rome and aquila and priscilla leave rome with the other jew come to asia and there abode with the apostle paul who be confirm the church of that region whose foundation he have newly laid the sacred book of the act informs u also of these thing chapter the calamity which befell the jew in jerusalem on the day of the passover while claudius be still emperor it happen that so great a tumult and disturbance take place in jerusalem at the feast of the passover that thirty thousand of those jew alone who be forcibly crowd together at the gate of the temple perish be trample under foot by one another thus the festival become a season of mourn for all the nation and there be weep in every house these thing be related literally by josephus but claudius appoint agrippa son of agrippa king of the jew have sent felix a procurator of the whole country of samaria and galilee and of the land call perea and after he have reign thirteen year and eight month a he die and left nero a his successor in the empire chapter the event which take place in jerusalem during the reign of nero josephus again in the twentieth book of his antiquity relates the quarrel which arose among the priest during the reign of nero while felix be procurator of judea his word be a follow there arose a quarrel between the high priest on the one hand and the priest and leader of the people of jerusalem on the other and each of them collect a body of the boldest and most restless men and put himself at their head and whenever they met they hurl invective and stone at each other and there be no one that would interpose but these thing be do at will a if in a city destitute of a ruler and so great be the shamelessness and audacity of the high priest that they dare to send their servant to the threshingfloors to seize the tithe due to the priest and thus those of the priest that be poor be see to be perish of want in this way do the violence of the faction prevail over all justice and the same author again relates that about the same time there sprang up in jerusalem a certain kind of robber who by day a he say and in the middle of the city slew those who met them for especially at the feast they mingle with the multitude and with short sword which they conceal under their garment they stabbed the most distinguish men and when they fell the murderer themselves be among those who express their indignation and thus on account of the confidence which be repose in them by all they remain undiscovered the first that be slain by them be jonathan the high priest and after him many be kill every day until the fear become bad than the evil itself each one a in battle hourly expect death chapter the egyptian who be mention also in the act of the apostle after other matter he proceeds a follow but the jew be afflict with a great plague than these by the egyptian false prophet for there appear in the land an impostor who arouse faith in himself a a prophet and collect about thirty thousand of those whom he have deceive and lead them from the desert to the socalled mount of olive whence he be prepared to enter jerusalem by force and to overpower the roman garrison and seize the government of the people use those who make the attack with him a bodyguard but felix anticipate his attack and go out to meet him with the roman legionary and all the people join in the defense so that when the battle be fought the egyptian flee with a few follower but the most of them be destroyed or take captive josephus relates these event in the second book of his history but it be worth while compare the account of the egyptian give here with that contain in the act of the apostle in the time of felix it be say to paul by the centurion in jerusalem when the multitude of the jew raise a disturbance against the apostle art not thou he who before these day make an uproar and lead out into the wilderness four thousand men that be murderer these be the event which take place in the time of felix chapter paul have be sent bound from judea to rome make his defense and be acquit of every charge festus be sent by nero to be felixs successor under him paul have make his defense be sent bound to rome aristarchus be with him whom he also somewhere in his epistle quite naturally call his fellowprisoner and luke who write the act of the apostle brought his history to a close at this point after state that paul spent two whole year at rome a a prisoner at large and preach the word of god without restraint thus after he have make his defense it be say that the apostle be sent again upon the ministry of preach and that upon come to the same city a second time he suffer martyrdom in this imprisonment he write his second epistle to timothy in which he mention his first defense and his impend death but hear his testimony on these matter at my first answer he say no man stood with me but all men forsook me i pray god that it may not be laid to their charge notwithstanding the lord stood with me and strengthen me that by me the preach might be fully know and that all the gentile might hear and i be deliver out of the mouth of the lion he plainly indicates in these word that on the former occasion in order that the preach might be fulfil by him he be rescue from the mouth of the lion refer in this expression to nero a be probable on account of the latter cruelty he do not therefore afterward add the similar statement he will rescue me from the mouth of the lion for he saw in the spirit that his end would not be long delayed wherefore he add to the word and he deliver me from the mouth of the lion this sentence the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom indicate his speedy martyrdom which he also foretells still more clearly in the same epistle when he writes for i be now ready to be offer and the time of my departure be at hand in his second epistle to timothy moreover he indicates that luke be with him when he write but at his first defense not even he whence it be probable that luke write the act of the apostle at that time continue his history down to the period when he be with paul but these thing have be adduce by u to show that paul martyrdom do not take place at the time of that roman sojourn which luke record it be probable indeed that a nero be more dispose to mildness in the begin paul defense of his doctrine be more easily receive but that when he have advanced to the commission of lawless deed of dare he make the apostle a well a others the subject of his attack chapter the martyrdom of james who be call the brother of the lord but after paul in consequence of his appeal to caesar have be sent to rome by festus the jew be frustrate in their hope of entrap him by the snare which they have laid for him turn against james the brother of the lord to whom the episcopal seat at jerusalem bad be entrust by the apostle the follow dare measure be undertaken by them against him lead him into their midst they demand of him that he should renounce faith in christ in the presence of all the people but contrary to the opinion of all with a clear voice and with great boldness than they have anticipate he spoke out before the whole multitude and confess that our savior and lord jesus be the son of god but they be unable to bear longer the testimony of the man who on account of the excellence of ascetic virtue and of piety which he exhibit in his life be esteem by all a the most just of men and consequently they slew him opportunity for this deed of violence be furnish by the prevail anarchy which be cause by the fact that festus have die just at this time in judea and that the province be thus without a governor and head the manner of james death have be already indicate by the abovequoted word of clement who record that he be thrown from the pinnacle of the temple and be beaten to death with a club but hegesippus who live immediately after the apostle give the most accurate account in the fifth book of his memoir he writes a follow james the brother of the lord succeed to the government of the church in conjunction with the apostle he have be call the just by all from the time of our savior to the present day for there be many that bore the name of james he be holy from his mother womb and he drank no wine nor strong drink nor do he eat flesh no razor come upon his head he do not anoint himself with oil and he do not use the bath he alone be permit to enter into the holy place for he wore not woolen but linen garment and he be in the habit of enter alone into the temple and be frequently found upon his knee beg forgiveness for the people so that his knee become hard like those of a camel in consequence of his constantly bending them in his worship of god and ask forgiveness for the people because of his exceed great justice he be call the just and oblias which signifies in greek bulwark of the people and justice in accordance with what the prophet declare concern him now some of the seven sect which exist among the people and which have be mention by me in the memoir ask him what be the gate of jesus and he reply that he be the savior on account of these word some believe that jesus be the christ but the sect mention above do not believe either in a resurrection or in one come to give to every man accord to his work but a many a believe do so on account of james therefore when many even of the ruler believe there be a commotion among the jew and scribe and pharisee who say that there be danger that the whole people would be look for jesus a the christ come therefore in a body to james they say we entreat thee restrain the people for they be go astray in regard to jesus a if he be the christ we entreat thee to persuade all that have come to the feast of the passover concern jesus for we all have confidence in thee for we bear thee witness a do all the people that thou art just and dost not respect per son do thou therefore persuade the multitude not to be lead astray concern jesus for the whole people and all of u also have confidence in thee stand therefore upon the pinnacle of the temple that from that high position thou mayest be clearly see and that thy word may be readily heard by all the people for all the tribe with the gentile also be come together on account of the passover the aforesaid scribe and pharisee therefore place james upon the pinnacle of the temple and cry out to him and say thou just one in whom we ought all to have confidence forasmuch a the people be lead astray after jesus the crucify one declare to u what be the gate of jesus and he answer with a loud voice why do ye ask me concern jesus the son of man he himself sitteth in heaven at the right hand of the great power and be about to come upon the cloud of heaven and when many be fully convince and glory in the testimony of james and say hosanna to the son of david these same scribe and pharisee say again to one another we have do badly in supply such testimony to jesus but let u go up and throw him down in order that they may be afraid to believe him and they cry out say oh oh the just man be also in error and they fulfil the scripture write in isaiah let u take away the just man because he be troublesome to u therefore they shall eat the fruit of their doings so they go up and threw down the just man and say to each other let u stone james the just and they begin to stone him for he be not kill by the fall but he turn and knelt down and say i entreat thee lord god our father forgive them for they know not what they do and while they be thus stone him one of the priest of the son of rechab the son of the rechabites who be mention by jeremiah the prophet cry out say cease what do ye the just one prayeth for you and one of them who be a fuller take the club with which he beat out clothes and struck the just man on the head and thus he suffer martyrdom and they bury him on the spot by the temple and his monument still remains by the temple he become a true witness both to jew and greek that jesus be the christ and immediately vespasian besiege them these thing be related at length by hegesippus who be in agreement with clement james be so admirable a man and so celebrate among all for his justice that the more sensible even of the jew be of the opinion that this be the cause of the siege of jerusalem which happen to them immediately after his martyrdom for no other reason than their dare act against him josephus at least have not hesitate to testify this in his writing where he say these thing happen to the jew to avenge james the just who be a brother of jesus that be call the christ for the jew slew him although he be a most just man and the same writer record his death also in the twentieth book of his antiquity in the follow word but the emperor when he learn of the death of festus sent albinus to be procurator of judea but the young ananus who a we have already say have obtain the high priesthood be of an exceedingly bold and reckless disposition he belong moreover to the sect of the sadducee who be the most cruel of all the jew in the execution of judgment a we have already show ananus therefore be of this character and suppose that he have a favorable opportunity on account of the fact that festus be dead and albinus be still on the way call together the sanhedrim and brought before them the brother of jesus the socalled christ james by name together with some others and accuse them of violate the law and condemn them to be stone but those in the city who seem most moderate and skilled in the law be very angry at this and sent secretly to the king request him to order ananus to cease such proceeding for he have not do right even this first time and certain of them also go to meet albinus who be journeying from alexandria and remind him that it be not lawful for ananus to summon the sanhedrim without his knowledge and albinus be persuade by their representation write in anger to ananus threaten him with punishment and the king agrippa in consequence deprive him of the high priesthood which he have held three month and appoint jesus the son of damnaeus these thing be record in regard to james who be say to be the author of the first of the socalled catholic epistle but it be to be observe that it be dispute at least not many of the ancient have mention it a be the case likewise with the epistle that bear the name of jude which be also one of the seven socalled catholic epistle nevertheless we know that these also with the rest have be read publicly in very many church chapter annianus the first bishop of the church of alexandria after mark when nero be in the eighth year of his reign annianus succeed mark the evangelist in the administration of the parish of alexandria chapter the persecution under nero in which paul and peter be honor at rome with martyrdom in behalf of religion when the government of nero be now firmly establish he begin to plunge into unholy pursuit and arm himself even against the religion of the god of the universe to describe the greatness of his depravity do not lie within the plan of the present work a there be many indeed that have record his history in most accurate narrative every one may at his pleasure learn from them the coarseness of the man extraordinary madness under the influence of which after he have accomplish the destruction of so many myriad without any reason he ran into such bloodguiltiness that he do not spare even his near relative and dearest friend but destroyed his mother and his brother and his wife with very many others of his own family a he would private and public enemy with various kind of death but with all these thing this particular in the catalogue of his crime be still want that he be the first of the emperor who show himself an enemy of the divine religion the roman tertullian be likewise a witness of this he writes a follow examine your record there you will find that nero be the first that persecute this doctrine particularly then when after subdue all the east he exercise his cruelty against all at rome we glory in have such a man the leader in our punishment for whoever know him can understand that nothing be condemn by nero unless it be something of great excellence thus publicly announce himself a the first among god chief enemy he be lead on to the slaughter of the apostle it be therefore record that paul be behead in rome itself and that peter likewise be crucify under nero this account of peter and paul be substantiate by the fact that their name be preserve in the cemetery of that place even to the present day it be confirm likewise by caius a member of the church who arose under zephyrinus bishop of rome he in a publish disputation with proclus the leader of the phrygian heresy speaks a follow concern the place where the sacred corps of the aforesaid apostle be laid but i can show the trophy of the apostle for if you will go to the vatican or to the ostian way you will find the trophy of those who laid the foundation of this church and that they both suffer martyrdom at the same time be state by dionysius bishop of corinth in his epistle to the roman in the follow word you have thus by such an admonition bound together the plant of peter and of paul at rome and corinth for both of them plant and likewise taught u in our corinth and they taught together in like manner in italy and suffer martyrdom at the same time i have quote these thing in order that the truth of the history might be still more confirm chapter the jew afflict with innumerable evil commenced the last war against the roman josephus again after relate many thing in connection with the calamity which come upon the whole jewish nation record in addition to many other circumstance that a great many of the most honorable among the jew be scourge in jerusalem itself and then crucify by florus it happen that he be procurator of judea when the war begin to be kindle in the twelfth year of nero josephus say that at that time a terrible commotion be stir up throughout all syria in consequence of the revolt of the jew and that everywhere the latter be destroyed without mercy like enemy by the inhabitant of the city so that one could see city fill with unburied corps and the dead body of the age scatter about with the body of infant and woman without even a cover for their nakedness and the whole province full of indescribable calamity while the dread of those thing that be threaten be great than the suffering themselves which they anywhere endure such be the account of josephus and such be the condition of the jew at that time book iii chapter the part of the world in which the apostle preach christ such be the condition of the jew meanwhile the holy apostle and disciple of our savior be disperse throughout the world parthia accord to tradition be allot to thomas a his field of labor scythia to andrew and asia to john who after he have live some time there die at ephesus peter appear to have preach in pontus galatia bithynia cappadocia and asia to the jew of the dispersion and at last have come to rome he be crucify headdownwards for he have request that he might suffer in this way what do we need to say concern paul who preach the gospel of christ from jerusalem to illyricum and afterwards suffer martyrdom in rome under nero these fact be related by origen in the third volume of his commentary on genesis chapter the first ruler of the church of rome after the martyrdom of paul and of peter linus be the first to obtain the episcopate of the church at rome paul mention him when write to timothy from rome in the salutation at the end of the epistle chapter the epistle of the apostle one epistle of peter that call the first be acknowledge a genuine and this the ancient elder use freely in their own writing a an undisputed work but we have learn that his extant second epistle do not belong to the canon yet a it have appear profitable to many it have be use with the other scripture the socalled act of peter however and the gospel which bear his name and the preach and the apocalypse a they be call we know have not be universally accepted because no ecclesiastical writer ancient or modern have make use of testimony drawn from them but in the course of my history i shall be careful to show in addition to the official succession what ecclesiastical writer have from time to time make use of any of the dispute work and what they have say in regard to the canonical and accepted writing a well a in regard to those which be not of this class such be the writing that bear the name of peter only one of which i know to be genuine and acknowledge by the ancient elder paul fourteen epistle be well know and undisputed it be not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have reject the epistle to the hebrew say that it be dispute by the church of rome on the ground that it be not write by paul but what have be say concern this epistle by those who live before our time i shall quote in the proper place in regard to the socalled act of paul i have not found them among the undisputed writing but a the same apostle in the salutation at the end of the epistle to the roman have make mention among others of hermas to whom the book call the shepherd be ascribed it should be observe that this too have be dispute by some and on their account can not be place among the acknowledge book while by others it be consider quite indispensable especially to those who need instruction in the element of the faith hence a we know it have be publicly read in church and i have found that some of the most ancient writer use it this will serve to show the divine writing that be undisputed a well a those that be not universally acknowledge chapter the first successor of the apostle that paul preach to the gentile and laid the foundation of the church from jerusalem round about even unto illyricum be evident both from his own word and from the account which luke have give in the act and in how many province peter preach christ and taught the doctrine of the new covenant to those of the circumcision be clear from his own word in his epistle already mention a undisputed in which he writes to the hebrew of the dispersion in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia but the number and the name of those among them that become true and zealous follower of the apostle and be judged worthy to tend the church round by them it be not easy to tell except those mention in the writing of paul for he have innumerable fellowlaborers or fellowsoldiers a he call them and most of them be honor by him with an imperishable memorial for he give endure testimony concern them in his own epistle luke also in the act speaks of his friend and mention them by name timothy so it be record be the first to receive the episcopate of the parish in ephesus titus of the church in crete but luke who be of antiochian parentage and a physician by profession and who be especially intimate with paul and well acquaint with the rest of the apostle have left u in two inspire book proof of that spiritual heal art which he learn from them one of these book be the gospel which he testifies that he write a those who be from the begin eye witness and minister of the word deliver unto him all of whom a he say he follow accurately from the first the other book be the act of the apostle which he compose not from the account of others but from what he have see himself and they say that paul meant to refer to luke gospel wherever a if speak of some gospel of his own he use the word accord to my gospel a to the rest of his follower paul testifies that crescens be sent to gaul but linus whom he mention in the second epistle to timothy a his companion at rome be peter successor in the episcopate of the church there a have already be show clement also who be ap point third bishop of the church at rome be a paul testifies his colaborer and fellowsoldier besides these that areopagite name dionysius who be the first to believe after paul address to the athenian in the areopagus a record by luke in the act be mention by another dionysius an ancient writer and pastor of the parish in corinth a the first bishop of the church at athens but the event connect with the apostolic succession we shall relate at the proper time meanwhile let u continue the course of our history chapter the last siege of the jew after christ after nero have held the power thirteen year and galba and otho have rule a year and six month vespasian who have become distinguish in the campaign against the jew be proclaim sovereign in judea and receive the title of emperor from the army there set out immediately therefore for rome he entrust the conduct of the war against the jew to his son titus for the jew after the ascension of our savior in addition to their crime against him have be devise a many plot a they could against his apostle first stephen be stone to death by them and after him james the son of zebedee and the brother of john be behead and finally james the first that have obtain the episcopal seat in jerusalem after the ascension of our savior die in the manner already described but the rest of the apostle who have be incessantly plot against with a view to their destruction and have be driven out of the land of judea go unto all nation to preach the gospel rely upon the power of christ who have say to them go ye and make disciple of all the nation in my name but the people of the church in jerusalem have be command by a revelation vouchsafed to approve men there before the war to leave the city and to dwell in a certain town of perea call pella and when those that believe in christ have come thither from jerusalem then a if the royal city of the jew and the whole land of judea be entirely destitute of holy men the judgment of god at length overtook those who have commit such outrage against christ and his apostle and totally destroyed that generation of impious men but the number of calamity which every where fell upon the nation at that time the extreme misfortune to which the inhabitant of judea be especially subject the thousand of men a well a woman and child that perish by the sword by famine and by other form of death innumerable all these thing a well a the many great siege which be carry on against the city of judea and the excessive suffering endure by those that flee to jerusalem itself a to a city of perfect safety and finally the general course of the whole war a well a it particular occurrence in detail and how at last the abomination of desolation proclaim by the prophet stood in the very temple of god so celebrate of old the temple which be now await it total and final destruction by fire all these thing any one that wish may find accurately described in the history write by josephus but it be necessary to state that this writer record that the multitude of those who be assemble from all judea at the time of the passover to the number of three million soul be shut up in jerusalem a in a prison to use his own word for it be right that in the very day in which they have inflict suffer upon the savior and the benefactor of all the christ of god that in those day shut up a in a prison they should meet with destruction at the hand of divine justice but passing by the particular calamity which they suffer from the attempt make upon them by the sword and by other mean i think it necessary to relate only the misfortune which the famine cause that those who read this work may have some mean of know that god be not long in execute vengeance upon them for their wickedness against the christ of god chapter the famine which oppress them take the fifth book of the history of josephus again in our hand let u go through the tragedy of event which then occur for the wealthy he say it be equally dangerous to remain for under pretense that they be go to desert men be put to death for their wealth the madness of the sedition increase with the famine and both the misery be inflame more and more day by day nowhere be food to be see but bursting into the house men search them thoroughly and whenever they found anything to eat they torment the owner on the ground that they have deny that they have anything but if they found nothing they torture them on the ground that they have more carefully conceal it the proof of their have or not have food be found in the body of the poor wretch those of them who be still in good condition they assume be well supply with food while those who be already waste away they pass by for it seem absurd to slay those who be on the point of perish for want many indeed secretly sell their possession for one measure of wheat if they belong to the wealthier class of barley if they be poorer then shut themselves up in the innermost part of their house some ate the grain uncooked on account of their terrible want while others bake it accord a necessity and fear dictate nowhere be table set but snatch the yet uncooked food from the fire they tore it in piece wretched be the fare and a lamentable spectacle it be to see the more powerful secure an abundance while the weaker mourn of all evil indeed famine be the bad and it destroys nothing so effectively a shame for that which under other circumstance be worthy of respect in the midst of famine be despise thus woman snatch the food from the very mouth of their husband and child from their father and what be most pitiable of all mother from their babe and while their dearest one be waste away in their arm they be not ashamed to take away froth them the last drop that support life and even while they be eat thus they do not remain undiscovered but everywhere the rioter appear to rob them even of these portion of food for whenever they saw a house shut up they regard it a a sign that those inside be take food and immediately bursting open the door they rush in and seize what they be eat almost force it out of their very throat old men who clung to their food be beaten and if the woman conceal it in their hand their hair be torn for so do there be pity neither for gray hair nor for infant but take up the babe that clung to their morsel of food they dash them to the ground but to those that anticipate their entrance and swallow what they be about to seize they be still more cruel just a if they have be wrong by them and they devise the most terrible mode of torture to discover food stop up the privy passage of the poor wretch with bitter herb and pierce their seat with sharp rod and men suffer thing horrible even to hear of for the sake of compelling them to confess to the possession of one loaf of bread or in order that they might be make to disclose a single drachma of barley which they have conceal but the tormentor themselves do not suffer hunger their conduct might indeed have seem less barbarous if they have be driven to it by necessity but they do it for the sake of exercise their madness and of provide sustenance for themselves for day to come and when any one crept out of the city by night a far a the outpost of the roman to collect wild herb and grass they go to meet him and when he thought he have already escape the enemy they seize what he have brought with him and even though oftentimes the man would entreat them and call upon the most awful name of god adjure them to give him a portion of what he have obtain at the risk of his life they would give him nothing back indeed it be fortunate if the one that be plunder be not also slain to this account josephus after relate other thing add the follow the possibility of go out of the city be brought to an end all hope of safety for the jew be cut off and the famine increase and devour the people by house and family and the room be fill with dead woman and child the lane of the city with the corps of old men child and youth swollen with the famine wander about the marketplace like shadow and fell down wherever the death agony overtook them the sick be not strong enough to bury even their own relative and those who have the strength hesitate because of the multitude of the dead and the uncertainty a to their own fate many indeed die while they be bury others and many betook themselves to their graf before death come upon them there be neither weep nor lamentation under these misfortune but the famine stifle the natural affection those that be die a linger death look with dry eye upon those that have go to their rest before them deep silence and deathladen night encircle the city but the robber be more terrible than these misery for they broke open the house which be now mere sepulcher robbed the dead and strip the cover from their body and go away with a laugh they try the point of their sword in the dead body and some that be lie on the ground still alive they thrust through in order to test their weapon but those that prayed that they would use their right hand and their sword upon them they contemptuously left to be destroyed by the famine every one of these die with eye fix upon the temple and they left the seditious alive these at first give order that the dead should be bury out of the public treasury for they could not endure the stench but afterward when they be not able to do this they threw the body from the wall into the trench and a titus go around and saw the trench fill with the dead and the thick blood ooze out of the putrid body he groan aloud and raise his hand call god to witness that this be not his do after speak of some other thing josephus proceeds a follow i can not hesitate to declare what my feeling compel me to i suppose if the roman have longer delayed in come against these guilty wretch the city would have be swallow up by a chasm or overwhelmed with a flood or struck with such thunderbolt a destroyed sodom for it have brought forth a generation of men much more godless than be those that suffer such punishment by their madness indeed be the whole people brought to destruction and in the sixth book he writes a follow of those that perish by famine in the city the number be countless and the misery they underwent unspeakable for if so much a the shadow of food appear in any house there be war and the dearest friend engage in handtohand conflict with one another and snatch from each other the most wretched support of life nor would they believe that even the die be without food but the robber would search them while they be expire l any one should feign death while conceal food in his bosom with mouth gap for want of food they stumble and stagger along like mad dog and beat the door a if they be drunk and in their impotence they would rush into the same house twice or thrice in one hour necessity compel them to eat anything they could find and they gather and devour thing that be not fit even for the filthiest of irrational beast finally they do not abstain even from their girdle and shoe and they strip the hide off their shield and devour them some use even wisp of old hay for food and others gather stubble and sell the small weight of it for four attic drachma but why should i speak of the shamelessness which be displayed during the famine toward inanimate thing for i be go to relate a fact such a be record neither by greek nor barbarian horrible to relate incredible to hear and indeed i should gladly have omit this calamity that i might not seem to posterity to be a teller of fabulous tale if i have not innumerable witness to it in my own age and besides i should render my country poor service if i suppress the account of the suffering which she endure there be a certain woman name mary that dwelt beyond jordan whose father be eleazer of the village of bathezor which signifies the house of hyssop she be distinguish for her family and her wealth and have flee with the rest of the multitude to jerusalem and be shut up there with them during the siege the tyrant have robbed her of the rest of the property which she have brought with her into the city from perea and the remnant of her possession and whatever food be to be see the guard rush in daily and snatch away from her this make the woman terribly angry and by her frequent reproach and imprecation she arouse the anger of the rapacious villain against herself but no one either through anger or pity would slay her and she grow weary of find food for others to eat the search too be already become everywhere difficult and the famine be pierce her bowel and marrow and resentment be rag more violently than famine take therefore anger and necessity a her counselor she proceed to do a most unnatural thing seize her child a boy which be suck at her breast she say oh wretched child m war in famine in sedition for what do i preserve thee slave among the roman we shall be even if we be allow to live by them but even slavery be anticipate by the famine and the rioter be more cruel than both come be food for me a fury for these rioter and a byeword to the world for this be all that be want to complete the calamity of the jew and when she have say this she slew her son and have roast him she ate one half herself and cover up the remainder she kept it very soon the rioter appear on the scene and smell the nefarious odor they threaten to slay her immediately unless she should show them what she have prepared she reply that she have save an excellent portion for them and with that she uncovered the remains of the child they be immediately seize with horror and amazement and stood transfixed at the sight but she say this be my own son and the deed be mine eat for i too have eat be not more merciful than a woman nor more compassionate than a mother but if you be too pious and shrink from my sacrifice i have already eat of so it let the rest also remain for me at these word the men go out tremble in this one case be affright yet with difficulty do they yield that food to the mother forthwith the whole city be fill with the awful crime and a all picture the terrible deed before their own eye they tremble a if they have do it themselves those that be suffer from the famine now long for death and bless be they that have die before hearing and see misery like these such be the reward which the jew receive for their wickedness and impiety against the christ of god chapter the prediction of christ it be fitting to add to these account the true prediction of our savior in which he foretold these very event his word be a follow woe unto them that be with child and to them that give suck in those day but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day for there shall be great tribulation such a be not since the begin of the world to this time no nor ever shall be the historian reckon the whole number of the slain say that eleven hundred thousand person perish by famine and sword and that the rest of the rioter and robber be betrayed by each other after the take of the city be slain but the tallest of the youth and those that be distinguish for beauty be preserve for the triumph of the rest of the multitude those that be over seventeen year of age be sent a prisoner to labor in the work of egypt while still more be scatter through the province to meet their death in the theater by the sword and by beast those under seventeen year of age be carry away to be sell a slave and of these alone the number reach ninety thousand these thing take place in this manner in the second year of the reign of vespasian in accordance with the prophecy of our lord and savior jesus christ who by divine power saw them beforehand a if they be already present and wept and mourn accord to the statement of the holy evangelist who give the very word which be uttered when a if address jerusalem herself he say if thou hadst know even thou in this day the thing which belong unto thy peace but now they be hid from thine eye for the day shall come upon thee that thine enemy shall cast a rampart about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee and thy child even with the ground and then a if speak concern the people he say for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be lead away captive into all nation and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentile until the time of the gentile be fulfil and again when ye shall see jerusalem compass with army then know that the desolation thereof be nigh if any one compare the word of our savior with the other account of the historian concern the whole war how can one fail to wonder and to admit that the foreknowledge and the prophecy of our savior be truly divine and marvelously strange concern those calamity then that befell the whole jewish nation after the savior passion and after the word which the multitude of the jew uttered when they beg the release of the robber and murderer but besought that the prince of life should be take from their midst it be not necessary to add anything to the account of the historian but it may be proper to mention also those event which exhibit the graciousness of that allgood providence which held back their destruction full forty year after their crime against christ during which time many of the apostle and disciple and james himself the first bishop there the one who be call the brother of the lord be still alive and dwell in jerusalem itself remain the surest bulwark of the place divine providence thus still prove itself longsuffering toward them in order to see whether by repentance for what they have do they might obtain pardon and salvation and in addition to such longsuffering providence also furnish wonderful sign of the thing which be about to happen to them if they do not repent since these matter have be thought worthy of mention by the historian already cite we can not do well than to recount them for the benefit of the reader of this work chapter the sign which precede the war take then the work of this author read what he record in the sixth book of his history his word be a follow thus be the miserable people won over at this time by the impostor and false prophet but they do not heed nor give credit to the vision and sign that foretold the approach desolation on the contrary a if struck by lightning and a if possess neither eye nor understand they slight the proclamation of god at one time a star in form like a sword stood over the city and a comet which last for a whole year and again before the revolt and before the disturbance that lead to the war when the people be gather for the feast of unleavened bread on the eighth of the month xanthicus at the ninth hour of the night so great a light shone about the altar and the temple that it seem to be bright day and this continued for half an hour this seem to the unskillful a good sign but be interpret by the sacred scribe a portend those event which very soon take place and at the same feast a cow lead by the high priest to be sacrifice brought forth a lamb in the midst of the temple and the eastern gate of the inner temple which be of bronze and very massive and which at even be close with difficulty by twenty men and rest upon ironbound beam and have bar sunk deep in the ground be see at the sixth hour of the night to open of itself and not many day after the feast on the twentyfirst of the month artemisium a certain marvelous vision be see which pass belief the prodigy might seem fabulous be it not related by those who saw it and be not the calamity which follow deserve of such sign for before the set of the sun chariot and arm troop be see throughout the whole region in midair wheel through the cloud and encircle the city and at the feast which be call pentecost when the priest enter the temple at night a be their custom to perform the service they say that at first they perceive a movement and a noise and afterward a voice a of a great multitude say let u go hence but what follow be still more terrible for a certain jesus the son of ananias a common countryman four year before the war when the city be particularly prosperous and peaceful come to the feast at which it be customary for all to make tent at the temple to the honor of god and suddenly begin to cry out a voice from the east a voice from the west a voice from the four wind a voice against jerusalem and the temple a voice against bridegroom and bride a voice against all the people day and night he go through all the alley cry thus but certain of the more distinguish citizen vexed at the ominous cry seize the man and beat him with many stripe but without utter a word in his own behalf or say anything in particular to those that be present he continued to cry out in the same word a before and the ruler think a be true that the man be move by a high power brought him before the roman governor and then though he be scourge to the bone he neither make supplication nor shed tear but change his voice to the most lamentable tone possible he answer each stroke with the word woe woe unto jerusalem the same historian record another fact still more wonderful than this he say that a certain oracle be found in their sacred writing which declare that at that time a certain person should go forth from their country to rule the world he himself understood that this be fulfil in vespasian but vespasian do not rule the whole world but only that part of it which be subject to the roman with well right could it be apply to christ to whom it be say by the father ask of me and i will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the end of the earth for thy possession at that very time indeed the voice of his holy apostle go throughout all the earth and their word to the end of the world chapter josephus and the work which he have left after all this it be fitting that we should know something in regard to the origin and family of josephus who have contribute so much to the history in hand he himself give u information on this point in the follow word josephus the son of mattathias a priest of jerusalem who himself fought against the roman in the begin and be compel to be present at what happen afterward he be the most note of all the jew of that day not only among his own people but also among the roman so that he be honor by the erection of a statue in rome and his work be deem worthy of a place in the library he write the whole of the antiquity of the jew in twenty book and a history of the war with the roman which take place in his time in seven book he himself testifies that the latter work be not only write in greek but that it be also translate by himself into his native tongue he be worthy of credit here because of his truthfulness in other matter there be extant also two other book of his which be worth reading they treat of the antiquity of the jew and in them he reply to apion the grammarian who have at that time write a treatise against the jew and also to others who have attempt to vilify the hereditary institution of the jewish people in the first of these book he give the number of the canonical book of the socalled old testament apparently draw his information from ancient tradition he show what book be accepted without dispute among the hebrew his word be a follow chapter the manner in which josephus mention the divine book we have not therefore a multitude of book disagree and conflict with one another but we have only twentytwo which contain the record of all time and be justly held to be divine of these five be by moses and contain the law and the tradition respect the origin of man and continue the history down to his own death this period embrace nearly three thousand year from the death of moses to the death of artaxerxes who succeed xerxes a king of persia the prophet that follow moses write the history of their own time in thirteen book the other four book contain hymn to god and precept for the regulation of the life of men from the time of artaxerxes to our own day all the event have be record but the account be not worthy of the same confidence that we repose in those which precede them because there have not be during this time an exact succession of prophet how much we be attach to our own writing be show plainly by our treatment of them for although so great a period have already pass by no one have venture either to add to or to take from them but it be inbred in all jew from their very birth to regard them a the teaching of god and to abide by them and if necessary cheerfully to die for them these remark of the historian i have thought might advantageously be introduce in this connection another work of no little merit have be produce by the same writer on the supremacy of reason which some have call maccabaicum because it contains an account of the struggle of those hebrew who contend manfully for the true religion a be related in the book call maccabees and at the end of the twentieth book of his antiquity josephus himself intimate that he have purpose to write a work in four book concern god and his existence accord to the traditional opinion of the jew and also concern the law why it be that they permit some thing while prohibit others and the same writer also mention in his own work other book write by himself in addition to these thing it be proper to quote also the word that be found at the close of his antiquity in confirmation of the testimony which we have drawn from his account in that place he attack justus of tiberias who like himself have attempt to write a history of contemporary event on the ground that he have not write truthfully have brought many other accusation against the man he continue in these word i indeed be not afraid in respect to my writing a you be but on the contrary i present my book to the emperor themselves when the event be almost under men eye for i be conscious that i have preserve the truth in my account and hence be not disappointed in my expectation of obtain their attestation and i present my history also to many others some of whom be present at the war a for instance king agrippa and some of his relative for the emperor titus desire so much that the knowledge of the event should be communicate to men by my history alone that he endorse the book with his own hand and command that they should be publish and king agrippa write sixtytwo epistle testify to the truthfulness of my account of these epistle josephus subjoins two but this will suffice in regard to him let u now proceed with our history chapter symeon rule the church of jerusalem after james after the martyrdom of james and the conquest of jerusalem which immediately follow it be say that those of the apostle and disciple of the lord that be still living come together from all direction with those that be related to the lord accord to the flesh for the majority of them also be still alive to take counsel a to who be worthy to succeed james they all with one consent pronounce symeon the son of clopas of whom the gospel also make mention to be worthy of the episcopal throne of that parish he be a cousin a they say of the savior for hegesippus record that clopas be a brother of joseph chapter vespasian command the descendant of david to be sought he also relates that vespasian after the conquest of jerusalem give order that all that belong to the lineage of david should be sought out in order that none of the royal race might be left among the jew and in consequence of this a most terrible persecution again hung over the jew chapter anencletus the second bishop of rome after vespasian have reign ten year titus his son succeed him in the second year of his reign linus who have be bishop of the church of rome for twelve year deliver his office to anencletus but titus be succeed by his brother domitian after he have reign two year and the same number of month chapter abilius the second bishop of alexandria in the fourth year of domitian annianus the first bishop of the parish of alexandria die after hold office twentytwo year and be succeed by abilius the second bishop chapter clement the third bishop of rome in the twelfth year of the same reign clement succeed anencletus after the latter have be bishop of the church of rome for twelve year the apostle in his epistle to the philippian informs u that this clement be his fellowworker his word be a follow with clement arid the rest of my fellowlaborers whose name be in the book of life chapter the epistle of clement there be extant an epistle of this clement which be acknowledge to be genuine and be of considerable length and of remarkable merit he write it in the name of the church of rome to the church of corinth when a sedition have arisen in the latter church we know that this epistle also have be publicly use in a great many church both in former time and in our own and of the fact that a sedition do take place in the church of corinth at the time refer to hegesippus be a trustworthy witness chapter the persecution under domitian domitian have show great cruelty toward many and have unjustly put to death no small number of wellborn and notable men at rome and have without cause exile and confiscate the property of a great many other illustrious men finally become a successor of nero in his hatred and enmity toward god he be in fact the second that stir up a persecution against u although his father vespasian have undertaken nothing prejudicial to u chapter the apostle john and the apocalypse it be say that in this persecution the apostle and evangelist john who be still alive be condemn to dwell on the island of patmos in consequence of his testimony to the divine word irenaeus in the fifth book of his work against heresy where he discus the number of the name of antichrist which be give in the socalled apocalypse of john speaks a follow concern him a if it be necessary for his name to be proclaim openly at the present time it would have be declare by him who saw the revelation for it be see not long ago but almost in our own generation at the end of the reign of domitian to such a degree indeed do the teach of our faith flourish at that time that even those writer who be far from our religion do not hesitate to mention in their history the persecution and the martyrdom which take place during it and they indeed accurately indicate the time for they record that in the fifteenth year of domitian flavia domitilla daughter of a sister of flavius clement who at that time be one of the consul of rome be exile with many others to the island of pontia in consequence of testimony born to christ chapter domitian command the descendant of david to be slain but when this same domitian have command that the descendant of david should be slain an ancient tradition say that some of the heretic brought accusation against the descendant of jude say to have be a brother of the savior accord to the flesh on the ground that they be of the lineage of david and be related to christ himself hegesippus relates these fact in the follow word chapter the relative of our savior of the family of the lord there be still living the grandchild of jude who be say to have be the lord brother accord to the flesh information be give that they belong to the family of david and they be brought to the emperor domitian by the evocatus for domitian fear the come of christ a herod also have fear it and he ask them if they be descendant of david and they confess that they be then he ask them how much property they have or how much money they own and both of them answer that they have only nine thousand denarii half of which belong to each of them and this property do not consist of silver but of a piece of land which contain only thirtynine acre and from which they raise their tax and support themselves by their own labor then they show their hand exhibit the hardness of their body and the callousness produce upon their hand by continuous toil a evidence of their own labor and when they be ask concern christ and his kingdom of what sort it be and where and when it be to appear they answer that it be not a temporal nor an earthly kingdom but a heavenly and angelic one which would appear at the end of the world when he should come in glory to judge the quick and the dead and to give unto every one accord to his work upon hearing this domitian do not pas judgment against them but despise them a of no account he let them go and by a decree put a stop to the persecution of the church but when they be release they rule the church because they be witness and be also relative of the lord and peace be establish they live until the time of trojan these thing be related by hegesippus tertullian also have mention domitian in the follow word domitian also who possess a share of nero cruelty attempt once to do the same thing that the latter do but because he have i suppose some intelligence he very soon cease and even recall those whom he have banish but after domitian have reign fifteen year and nerva have succeed to the empire the roman senate accord to the writer that record the history of those day vote that domitian honor should be cancel and that those who have be unjustly banish should return to their home and have their property restore to them it be at this time that the apostle john return from his banishment in the island and take up his abode at ephesus accord to an ancient christian tradition chapter cerdon becomes the third ruler of the church of alexandria after nerva have reign a little more than a year he be succeed by trojan it be during the first year of his reign that abilius who have rule the church of alexandria for thirteen year be succeed by cerdon he be the third that preside over that church after annianus who be the first at that time clement still rule the church of rome be also the third that held the episcopate there after paul and peter linus be the first and after him come anencletus chapter ignatius the second bishop of antioch at this time ignatius be know a the second bishop of antioch evodius have be the first symeon likewise be at that time the second ruler of the church of jerusalem the brother of our savior have be the first chapter narrative concern john the apostle at that time the apostle and evangelist john the one whom jesus love be still living in asia and govern the church of that region have return after the death of domitian from his exile on the island and that he be still alive at that time may be establish by the testimony of two witness they should be trustworthy who have maintain the orthodoxy of the church and such indeed be irenaeus and clement of alexandria the former in the second book of his work against heresy writes a follow and all the elder that associate with john the disciple of the lord in asia bear witness that john deliver it to them for he remain among them until the time of trajan and in the third book of the same work he attests the same thing in the follow word but the church in ephesus also which be found by paul and where john remain until the time of trajan be a faithful witness of the apostolic tradition clement likewise in his book entitle what rich man can be save indicates the time and subjoins a narrative which be most attractive to those that enjoy hearing what be beautiful and profitable take and read the account which rim a follow listen to a tale which be not a mere tale but a narrative concern john the apostle which have be hand down and treasure up in memory for when after the tyrant death he return from the isle of patmos to ephesus he go away upon their invitation to the neighbor territory of the gentile to appoint bishop in some place in other place to set in order whole church elsewhere to choose to the ministry some one of those that be point out by the spirit when he have come to one of the city not far away the name of which be give by some and have console the brother in other matter he finally turn to the bishop that have be appoint and see a youth of powerful physique of please appearance and of ardent temperament he say this one i commit to thee in all earnestness in the presence of the church and with christ a witness and when the bishop have accepted the charge and have promise all he repeat the same injunction with an appeal to the same witness and then depart for ephesus but the presbyter take home the youth commit to him rear kept cherished and finally baptize him after this he relaxed his stricter care and watchfulness with the idea that in put upon him the seal of the lord he have give him a perfect protection but some youth of his own age idle and dissolute and accustom to evil practice corrupt him when he be thus prematurely freed from restraint at first they entice him by costly entertainment then when they go forth at night for robbery they take him with them and finally they demand that he should unite with them in some great crime he gradually become accustom to such practice and on account of the positiveness of his character leave the right path and take the bit in his teeth like a hardmouthed and powerful horse he rush the more violently down into the depth and finally despair of salvation in god he no longer meditate what be insignificant but have commit some great crime since he be now lose once for all he expect to suffer a like fate with the rest take them therefore and form a band of robber he become a bold banditchief the most violent most bloody most cruel of them all time pass and some necessity have arisen they sent for john but he when he have set in order the other matter on account of which he have come say come o bishop restore u the deposit which both i and christ commit to thee the church over which thou presidest be witness but the bishop be at first confound think that he be falsely charge in regard to money which he have not receive and he could neither believe the accusation respect what he have not nor could he disbelieve john but when he say i demand the young man and the soul of the brother the old man groan deeply and at the same time bursting into tear say he be dead how and what kind of death he be dead to god he say for he turn wicked and abandon and at last a robber and now instead of the church he haunt the mountain with a band like himself but the apostle rent his clothes and beating his head with great lamentation he say a fine guard i left for a brother soul but let a horse be brought me and let some one show me the way he rode away from the church just a he be and come to the place he be take prisoner by the robber outpost he however neither flee nor make entreaty but cry out for this do i come lead me to your captain the latter meanwhile be wait arm a he be but when he recognize john approach he turn in shame to flee but john forget his age pursue him with all his might cry out why my son dost thou flee from me thine own father unarmed age pity me my son fear not thou hast still hope of life i will give account to christ for thee if need be i will willingly endure thy death a the lord suffer death for u for thee will i give up my life stand believe christ hath sent me and he when he heard first stop and look down then he threw away his arm and then tremble and wept bitterly and when the old man approach he embrace him make confession with lamentation a he be able baptizing himself a second time with tear and conceal only his right hand but john pledge himself and assure him on oath that he would find forgiveness with the savior besought him fell upon his knee kiss his right hand itself a if now purify by repentance and lead him back to the church and make intercession for him with copious prayer and struggle together with him in continual fasting and subdue his mind by various utterance he do not depart a they say until he have restore him to the church furnish a great example of true repentance and a great proof of regeneration a trophy of a visible resurrection chapter the order of the gospel this extract from clement i have insert here for the sake of the history and for the benefit of my reader let u now point out the undisputed writing of this apostle and in the first place his gospel which be know to all the church under heaven must be acknowledge a genuine that it have with good reason be put by the ancient in the fourth place after the other three gospel may be make evident in the follow way those great and truly divine men i mean the apostle of christ be purify in their life and be adorn with every virtue of the soul but be uncultivated in speech they be confident indeed in their trust in the divine and wonderworking power which be grant unto them by the savior but they do not know how nor do they attempt to proclaim the doctrine of their teacher in study and artistic language but employ only the demonstration of the divine spirit which work with them and the wonderworking power of christ which be displayed through them they publish the knowledge of the kingdom of heaven throughout the whole world pay little attention to the composition of write work and this they do because they be assist in their ministry by one great than man paul for instance who surpass them all in vigor of expression and in richness of thought commit to write no more than the briefest epistle although he have innumerable mysterious matter to communicate for he have attain even unto the sight of the third heaven have be carry to the very paradise of god and have be deem worthy to heat unspeakable utterance there and the rest of the follower of our savior the twelve apostle the seventy disciple and countless others besides be not ignorant of these thing nevertheless of all the disciple of the lord only matthew and john have left u write memorial and they tradition say be lead to write only under the pressure of necessity for matthew who have at first preach to the hebrew when he be about to go to other people commit his gospel to write in his native tongue and thus compensate those whom he be oblige to leave for the loss of his presence and when mark and luke have already publish their gospel they say that john who have employ all his time in proclaim the gospel orally finally proceed to write for the follow reason the three gospel already mention have come into the hand of all and into his own too they say that he accepted them and bore witness to their truthfulness but that there be lack in them an account of the deed do by christ at the begin of his ministry and this indeed be true for it be evident that the three evangelist record only the deed do by the savior for one year after the imprisonment of john the baptist and indicate this in the begin of their account for matthew after the forty day fast and the temptation which follow it indicates the chronology of his work when he say now when he heard that john be deliver up he withdrew from judea into galilee mark likewise say now after that john be deliver up jesus come into galilee and luke before commence his account of the deed of jesus similarly mark the time when he say that herod add to all the evil deed which he have do shut up john in prison they say therefore that the apostle john be ask to do it for this reason give in his gospel an account of the period which have be omit by the earlier evangelist and of the deed do by the savior during that period that be of those which be do before the imprisonment of the baptist and this be indicate by him they say in the follow word this begin of miracle do jesus and again when he refers to the baptist in the midst of the deed of jesus a still baptizing in non near salim where he state the matter clearly in the word for john be not yet cast into prison john accordingly in his gospel record the deed of christ which be perform before the baptist be cast into prison but the other three evangelist mention the event which happen after that time one who understands this can no longer think that the gospel be at variance with one another inasmuch a the gospel accord to john contains the first act of christ while the others give an account of the latter part of his life and the genealogy of our savior accord to the flesh john quite naturally omit because it have be already give by matthew and luke and begin with the doctrine of his divinity which have a it be be reserve for him a their superior by the divine spirit these thing may suffice which we have say concern the gospel of john the cause which lead to the composition of the gospel of mark have be already state by u but a for luke in the begin of his gospel he state he state that since many others have more rashly undertaken to compose a narrative of the event of which he have acquire perfect knowledge he himself feel the necessity of free u from their uncertain opinion deliver in his own gospel an accurate account of those event in regard to which he have learn the full truth be aid by his intimacy and his stay with paul and by his acquaintance with the rest of the apostle so much for our own account of these thing but in a more fitting place we shall attempt to show by quotation from the ancient what others have say concern them but of the writing of john not only his gospel but also the former of his epistle have be accepted without dispute both now and in ancient time but the other two be dispute in regard to the apocalypse the opinion of most men be still divide but at the proper time this question likewise shall be decide from the testimony of the ancient chapter the divine scripture that be accept and those that be not since we be deal with this subject it be proper to sum up the writing of the new testament which have be already mention first then must be put the holy quaternion of the gospel follow them the act of the apostle after this must be reckon the epistle of paul next in order the extant former epistle of john and likewise the epistle of peter must be maintain after them be to be place if it really seem proper the apocalypse of john concern which we shall give the different opinion at the proper time these then belong among the accepted writing among the dispute writing which be nevertheless recognize n by many be extant the socalled epistle of james and that of jude also the second epistle of peter and those that be call the second and third of john whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name among the reject writing must be reckon also the act of paul and the socalled shepherd and the apocalypse of peter and in addition to these the extant epistle of barnabas and the socalled teaching of the apostle and besides a i say the apocalypse of john if it seem proper which some a i say reject but which others class with the accepted book and among these some have place also the gospel accord to the hebrew with which those of the hebrew that have accepted christ be especially delighted and all these may be reckon among the dispute book but we have nevertheless felt compel to give a catalogue of these also distinguish those work which accord to ecclesiastical tradition be true and genuine and commonly accepted from those others which although not canonical but dispute be yet at the same time know to most ecclesiastical writer we have felt compel to give this catalogue in order that we might be able to know both these work and those that be cite by the heretic under the name of the apostle include for instance such book a the gospel of peter of thomas of matthias or of any others besides them and the act of andrew and john and the other apostle which no one belonging to the succession of ecclesiastical writer have deem worthy of mention in his writing and far the character of the style be at variance with apostolic usage and both the thought and the purpose of the thing that be related in them be so completely out of accord with true orthodoxy that they clearly show themselves to be the fiction of heretic wherefore they be not to be place even among the reject writing but be all of them to be cast aside a absurd and impious let u now proceed with our history chapter menander the sorcerer menander who succeed simon magus show himself in his conduct another instrument of diabolical power not inferior to the former he also be a samaritan and carry his sorcery to no less an extent than his teacher have do and at the same time revel in still more marvelous tale than he for he say that he be himself the savior who have be sent down from invisible aeon for the salvation of men and he taught that no one could gain the mastery over the worldcreating angel themselves unless he have first go through the magical discipline impart by him and have receive baptism from him those who be deem worthy of this would partake even in the present life of perpetual immortality and would never die but would remain here forever and without grow old become immortal these fact can be easily learn from the work of irenaeus and justin in the passage in which he mention simon give an account of this man also in the follow word and we know that a certain menander who be also a samaritan from the village of capparattea be a disciple of simon and that he also be driven by the demon come to antioch and deceive many by his magical art and he persuade his follower that they should not die and there be still some of them that assert this and it be indeed an artifice of the devil to endeavor by mean of such sorcerer who assume the name of christian to defame the great mystery of godliness by magic art and through them to make ridiculous the doctrine of the church concern the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the dead but they that have chosen these men a their savior have fall away from the true hope chapter the heresy of the ebionite the evil demon however be unable to tear certain others from their allegiance to the christ of god yet found them susceptible in a different direction and so brought them over to his own purpose the ancient quite properly call these men ebionite because they held poor and mean opinion concern christ for they consider him a plain and common man who be justified only because of his superior virtue and who be the fruit of the intercourse of a man with mary in their opinion the observance of the ceremonial law be altogether necessary on the ground that they could not be save by faith in christ alone and by a correspond life there be others however besides them that be of the same name but avoid the strange and absurd belief of the former and do not deny that the lord be born of a virgin and of the holy spirit but nevertheless inasmuch a they also refuse to acknowledge that he preexist be god word and wisdom they turn aside into the impiety of the former especially when they like them endeavor to observe strictly the bodily worship of the law these men moreover thought that it be necessary to reject all the epistle of the apostle whom they call an apostate from the law and they use only the socalled gospel accord to the hebrew and make small account of the rest the sabbath and the rest of the discipline of the jew they observe just like them but at the same time like u they celebrate the lord day a a memorial of the resurrection of the savior wherefore in consequence of such a course they receive the name of ebionite which signify the poverty of their understand for this be the name by which a poor man be call among the hebrew chapter cerinthus the heresiarch we have understood that at this time cerinthus the author of another heresy make his appearance caius whose word we quote above in the disputation which be ascribed to him writes a follow concern this man but cerinthus also by mean of revelation which he pretend be write by a great apostle brings before u marvelous thing which he falsely claim be show him by angel and he say that after the resurrection the kingdom of christ will be set up on earth and that the flesh dwell in jerusalem will again be subject to desire and pleasure and be an enemy of the scripture of god he asserts with the purpose of deceive men that there be to be a period of a thousand year a for marriage festival and dionysius who be bishop of the parish of alexandria in our day in the second book of his work on the promise where he say some thing concern the apocalypse of john which he draw from tradition mention this same man in the follow word but they say that cerinthus who found the sect which be call after him the cerinthian desire reputable authority for his fiction prefixed the name for the doctrine which he taught be this that the kingdom of christ will be an earthly one and a he be himself devote to the pleasure of the body and altogether sensual in his nature he dream that that kingdom would consist in those thing which he desire namely in the delight of the belly and of sexual passion that be to say in eat and drinking and marry and in festival and sacrifice and the slay of victim under the guise of which he thought he could indulge his appetite with a well grace these be the word of dionysius but irenaeus in the first book of his work against heresy give some more abominable false doctrine of the same man and in the third book relates a story which deserves to be record he say on the authority of polycarp that the apostle john once enter a bath to bathe but learn that cerinthus be within he sprang from the place and rush out of the door for he could not bear to remain under the same roof with him and he advise those that be with him to do the same say let u flee l the bath fall for cerinthus the enemy of the truth be within chapter nicolaus and the sect name after him at this time the socalled sect of the nicolaitans make it appearance and last for a very short time mention be make of it in the apocalypse of john they boast that the author of their sect be nicolaus one of the deacon who with stephen be appoint by the apostle for the purpose of minister to the poor clement of alexandria in the third book of his stroma relates the follow thing concern him they say that he have a beautiful wife and after the ascension of the savior be accuse by the apostle of jealousy he lead her into their midst and give permission to any one that wish to marry her for they say that this be in accord with that say of his that one ought to abuse the flesh and those that have follow his heresy imitate blindly and foolishly that which be do and say commit fornication without shame but i understand that nicolaus have to do with no other woman than her to whom he be married and that so far a his child be concerned his daughter continued in a state of virginity until old age and his son remain uncorrupt if this be so when he brought his wife whom he jealously love into the midst of the apostle he be evidently renounce his passion and when he use the expression to abuse the flesh he be inculcate selfcontrol in the face of those pleasure that be eagerly pursue for i suppose that in accordance with the command of the savior he do not wish to serve two master pleasure and the lord but they say that matthias also taught in the same manner that we ought to fight against and abuse the flesh and not give way to it for the sake of pleasure but strengthen the soul by faith and knowledge so much concern those who then attempt to pervert the truth but in less time than it have take to tell it become entirely extinct chapter xxx the apostle that be married clement indeed whose word we have just quote after the abovementioned fact give a statement on account of those who reject marriage of the apostle that have wife or will they say he reject even the apostle for peter and philip begat child and philip also give his daughter in marriage and paul do not hesitate in one of his epistle to greet his wife whom he do not take about with him that he might not be inconvenienced in his ministry and since we have mention this subject it be not improper to subjoin another account which be give by the same author and which be worth reading in the seventh book of his stroma he writes a follow they say accordingly that when the bless peter saw his own wife lead oat to die he rejoice because of her summons and her return home and call to her very encouragingly and comfortingly address her by name and say oh thou remember the lord such be the marriage of the bless and their perfect disposition toward those dearest to them this account be in keep with the subject in hand i have related here in it proper place chapter the death of john and philip the time and the manner of the death of paul and peter a well a their burial place have be already show by u the time of john death have also be give in a general way but his burial place be indicate by an epistle of polycrates who be bishop of the parish of ephesus address to victor bishop of rome in this epistle he mention him together with the apostle philip and his daughter in the follow word for in asia also great light have fall asleep which shall rise again on the last day at the come of the lord when he shall come with glory from heaven and shall seek out all the saint among these be philip one of the twelve apostle who sleep in hierapolis and his two age virgin daughter and another daughter who live in the holy spirit and now rest at ephesus and moreover john who be both a witness and a teacher who recline upon the bosom of the lord and be a priest wore the sacerdotal plate he also sleep at ephesus so much concern their death and in the dialogue of caius which we mention a little above proclus against whom he direct his disputation in agreement with what have be quote speaks thus concern the death of philip and his daughter after him there be four prophetess the daughter of philip at hierapolis in asia their tomb be there and the tomb of their father such be his statemerit but luke in the act of the apostle mention the daughter of philip who be at that time at caesarea in judea with their father and be honor with the gift of prophecy his word be a follow we come unto caesarea and enter into the house of philip the evangelist who be one of the seven we abode with him now this man have four daughter virgin which do prophesy we have thus set forth in these page what have come to our knowledge concern the apostle themselves and the apostolic age and concern the sacred writing which they have left u a well a concern those which be dispute but nevertheless have be publicly use by many in a great number of church and moreover concern those that be altogether reject and be out of harmony with apostolic orthodoxy have do this let u now proceed with our history chapter symeon bishop of jerusalem suffers martyrdom it be report that after the age of nero and domitian under the emperor whose time we be now record a persecution be stir up against u in certain city in consequence of a popular uprise in this persecution we have understood that symeon the son of clopas who a we have show be the second bishop of the church of jerusalem suffer martyrdom hegesippus whose word we have already quote in various place be a witness to this fact also speak of certain heretic he add that symeon be accuse by them at this time and since it be clear that he be a christian he be torture in various way for many day and astonish even the judge himself and his attendant in the high degree and finally he suffer a death similar to that of our lord but there be nothing like hearing the historian himself who writes a follow certain of these heretic brought accusation against symeon the son of clopas on the ground that he be a descendant of david and a christian and thus he suffer martyrdom at the age of one hundred and twenty year while trajan be emperor and atticus governor and the same writer say that his accuser also when search be make for the descendant of david be arrest a belonging to that family and it might be reasonably assume that symeon be one of those that saw and heard the lord judging from the length of his life and from the fact that the gospel make mention of mary the wife of clopas who be the father of symeon a have be already show the same historian say that there be also others descend from one of the socalled brother of the savior whose name be juda who after they have born testimony before domitian a have be already record in behalf of faith in christ live until the same reign he writes a follow they come therefore and take the lead of every church a witness and a relative of the lord and profound peace be establish in every church they remain until the reign of the emperor trajan and until the abovementioned symeon son of clopas an uncle of the lord be inform against by the heretic and be himself in like manner accuse for the same cause before the governor atticus and after be torture for many day he suffer martyrdom and all include even the proconsul marvel that at the age of one hundred and twenty year he could endure so much and order be give that he should be crucify in addition to these thing the same man while recount the event of that period record that the church up to that time have remain a pure and uncorrupted virgin since if there be any that attempt to corrupt the sound norm of the preach of salvation they lay until then conceal in obscure darkness but when the sacred college of apostle have suffer death in various form and the generation of those that have be deem worthy to hear the inspire wisdom with their own ear have pass away then the league of godless error take it rise a a result of the folly of heretical teacher who because none of the apostle be still living attempt henceforth with a bold face to proclaim in opposition to the preach of the truth the knowledge which be falsely socalled chapter trajan forbids the christian to be sought after so great a persecution be at that time open against u in many place that plinius secundus one of the most note of governor be disturbed by the great number of martyr communicate with the emperor concern the multitude of those that be put to death for their faith at the same time he inform him in his communication that he have not heard of their do anything profane or contrary to the law except that they arose at dawn and sang hymn to christ a a god but that the renounce adultery and murder and like criminal offense and do all thing in accordance with the law in reply to this trajan make the follow decree that the race of christian should not be sought after but when found should be punish on account of this the persecution which have threaten to be a most terrible one be to a certain degree checked but there be still left plenty of pretext for those who wish to do u harm sometimes the people sometimes the ruler in various place would lay plot against u so that although no great persecution take place local persecution be nevertheless go on in particular province and many of the faithful endure martyrdom in various form we have take our account from the latin apology of tertullian which we mention above the translation run a follow and indeed we have found that search for u have be forbidden for when plinius secundus the governor of a province have condemn certain christian and deprive them of their dignity he be confound by the multitude and be uncertain what far course to pursue he therefore communicate with trajan the emperor inform him that aside from their unwillingness to sacrifice he have found no impiety in them and he report this also that the christian arose early in the morning and sang hymn unto christ a a god and for the purpose of preserve their discipline forbade murder adultery avarice robbery and the like in reply to this trajan write that the race of christian should not be sought after but when found should be punish such be the event which take place at that time chapter evarestus the fourth bishop of the church of rome in the third year of the reign of the emperor mention above clement commit the episcopal government of the church of rome to evarestus and depart this life after he have superintend the teach of the divine word nine year in all chapter justus the third bishop of jerusalem but when symeon also have die in the manner described a certain jew by the name of justus succeed to the episcopal throne in jerusalem he be one of the many thousand of the circumcision who at that time believe in christ chapter ignatius and his epistle at that time polycarp a disciple of the apostle be a man of eminence in asia have be entrust with the episcopate of the church of smyrna by those who have see and heard the lord and at the same time papias bishop of the parish of hierapolis become well know a do also ignatius who be chosen bishop of antioch second in succession to peter and whose fame be still celebrate by a great many report say that he be sent from syria to rome and become food for wild beast on account of his testimony to christ and a he make the journey through asia under the strictest military surveillance he fortify the parish in the various city where he stop by oral homily and exhortation and warn them above all to be especially on their guard against the heresy that be then begin to prevail and exhort them to hold fast to the tradition of the apostle moreover he thought it necessary to attest that tradition in write and to give it a fix form for the sake of great security so when he come to smyrna where polycarp be he write an epistle to the church of ephesus in which he mention onesimus it pastor and another to the church of magnesia situate upon the maeander in which he make mention again of a bishop dama and finally one to the church of tralles whose bishop he state be at that time polybius in addition to these he write also to the church of rome entreat them not to secure his release from martyrdom and thus rob him of his earnest hope in confirmation of what have be say it be proper to quote briefly from this epistle he writes a follow from syria even unto rome i fight with wild beast by land and by sea by night and by day be bound amidst ten leopard that be a company of soldier who only become bad when they be well treat in the midst of their wrongdoing however i be more fully learn discipleship but i be not thereby justified may i have joy of the beast that be prepared for me and i pray that i may find them ready i will even coax them to devour me quickly that they may not treat me a they have some whom they have refuse to touch through fear and if they be unwilling i will compel them forgive me i know what be expedient for me now do i begin to be a disciple may naught of thing visible and thing invisible envy me that i may attain unto jesus christ let fire and cross and attack of wild beast let wrench of bone cut of limb crush of the whole body torture of the devil let all these come upon me if only i may attain unto jesus christ these thing he write from the abovementioned city to the church refer to and when he have left smyrna he write again from troas to the philadelphians and to the church of smyrna and particularly to polycarp who preside over the latter church and since he knew him well a an apostolic man he commend to him like a true and good shepherd the flock at antioch and besought him to care diligently for it and the same man write to the smyrnaeans use the follow word concern christ take i know not whence but i know and believe that he be in the flesh after the resurrection and when he come to peter and his companion he say to them take handle me and see that i be not an incorporeal spirit and immediately they touch him and believe irenaeus also knew of his martyrdom and mention his epistle in the follow word a one of our people say when he be condemn to the beast on account of his testimony unto god i be god wheat and by the teeth of wild beast be i ground that i may be found pure bread polycarp also mention these letter in the epistle to the philippian which be ascribed to him his word be a follow i exhort all of you therefore to be obedient and to practice all patience such a ye saw with your own eye not only in the bless ignatius and rufus and zosimus but also in others from among yourselves a well a in paul himself and the rest of the apostle be persuade that all these ran not in vain but in faith and righteousness and that they be go to their rightful place beside the lord with whom also they suffer for they love not the present world but him that die for our sake and be raise by god for u and afterwards he add you have write to me both you and ignatius that if any one go to syria he may carry with him the letter from you and this i will do if i have a suitable opportunity either i myself or one whom i send to be an ambassador for you also the epistle of ignatius which be sent to u by him and the others which we have with u we sent to you a you give charge they be append to this epistle and from them you will be able to derive great advantage for they comprise faith and patience and every kind of edification that pertaineth to our lord so much concern ignatius but he be succeed by hero in the episcopate of the church of antioch chapter the evangelist that be still eminent at that time among those that be celebrate at that time be quadratus who report say be renowned along with the daughter of philip for his prophetical gift and there be many others besides these who be know in those day and who occupy the first place among the successor of the apostle and they also be illustrious disciple of such great men built up the foundation of the church which have be laid by the apostle in every place and preach the gospel more and more widely and scatter the save seed of the kingdom of heaven far and near throughout the whole world for indeed most of the disciple of that time animate by the divine word with a more ardent love for philosophy have already fulfil the command of the savior and have distribute their good to the needy then start out upon long journey they perform the office of evangelist be fill with the desire to preach christ to those who have not yet heard the word of faith and to deliver to them the divine gospel and when they have only laid the foundation of the faith in foreign place they appoint others a pastor and entrust them with the nurture of those that have recently be brought in while they themselves go on again to other country and nation with the grace and the cooperation of god for a great many wonderful work be do through them by the power of the divine spirit so that at the first hearing whole multitude of men eagerly embrace the religion of the creator of the universe but since it be impossible for u to enumerate the name of all that become shepherd or evangelist in the church throughout the world in the age immediately succeed the apostle we have record a be fitting the name of those only who have transmit the apostolic doctrine to u in writing still extant chapter the epistle of clement and the writing falsely ascribed to him thus ignatius have do in the epistle which we have mention and clement in his epistle which be accepted by all and which he write in the name of the church of rome to the church of corinth in this epistle he give many thought drawn from the epistle to the hebrew and also quote verbally some of it expression thus show most plainly that it be not a recent production wherefore it have seem reasonable to reckon it with the other writing of the apostle for a paul have write to the hebrew in his native tongue some say that the evangelist luke others that this clement himself translate the epistle the latter seem more probable because the epistle of clement and that to the hebrew have a similar character in regard to style and still far because the thought contain in the two work be not very different but it must be observe also that there be say to be a second epistle of clement but we do not know that this be recognize like the former for we do not find that the ancient have make any use of it and certain men lengthy writing under his name contain dialogue of peter and apion but no mention have be make of these by the ancient for they do not even preserve the pure stamp of apostolic orthodoxy the acknowledge write of clement be well know we have spoken also of the work of ignatius and polycarp chapter the writing of papias there be extant five book of papias which bear the title exposition of oracle of the lord irenaeus make mention of these a the only work write by him in the follow word these thing be attest by papias an ancient man who be a hearer of john and a companion of polycarp in his fourth book for five book have be write by him these be the word of irenaeus but papias himself in the preface to his discourse by no mean declares that he be himself a hearer and eyewitness of the holy apostle but he show by the word which he us that he receive the doctrine of the faith from those who be their friend he say but i shall not hesitate also to put down for you along with my interpretation whatsoever thing i have at any time learn carefully from the elder and carefully remember guarantee their truth for i do not like the multitude take pleasure in those that speak much but in those that teach the truth not in those that relate strange commandment but in those that deliver the commandment give by the lord to faith and spring from the truth itself if then any one come who have be a follower of the elder i question him in regard to the word of the elder what andrew or what peter say or what be say by philip or by thomas or by james or by john or by matthew or by any other of the disciple of the lord and what thing aristion and the presbyter john the disciple of the lord say for i do not think that what be to be gotten from the book would profit me a much a what come from the living and abide voice it be worth while observe here that the name john be twice enumerate by him the first one he mention in connection with peter and james and matthew and the rest of the apostle clearly meaning the evangelist but the other john he mention after an interval and place him among others outside of the number of the apostle put aristion before him and he distinctly call him a presbyter this show that the statement of those be true who say that there be two person in asia that bore the same name and that there be two tomb in ephesus each of which even to the present day be call john it be important to notice this for it be probable that it be the second if one be not willing to admit that it be the first that saw the revelation which be ascribed by name to john and papias of whom we be now speak confesses that he receive the word of the apostle from those who follow them but say that he be himself a hearer of aristion and the presbyter john at least he mention them frequently by name and give their tradition in his writing these thing we hope have not be uselessly adduce by u but it be fitting to subjoin to the word of papias which have be quote other passage from his work in which he relates some other wonderful event which he claim to have receive from tradition that philip the apostle dwelt at hierapolis with his daughter have be already state but it must be note here that papias their contemporary say that he heard a wonderful tale from the daughter of philip for he relates that in his time one rise from the dead and he tell another wonderful story of justus surnamed barsabbas that he drank a deadly poison and yet by the grace of the lord suffer no harm the book of act record that the holy apostle after the ascension of the savior put forward this justus together with matthias and prayed that one might be chosen in place of the traitor juda to fill up their number the account be a follow and they put forward two joseph call barsabbas who be surnamed justus and matthias and they prayed and say the same writer give also other account which he say come to him through unwritten tradition certain strange parable and teaching of the savior and some other more mythical thing to these belong his statement that there will be a period of some thousand year after the resurrection of the dead and that the kingdom of christ will be set up in material form on this very earth i suppose he get these idea through a misunderstand of the apostolic account not perceive that the thing say by them be spoken mystically in figure for he appear to have be of very limited understand a one can see from his discourse but it be due to him that so many of the church father after him adopt a like opinion urge in their own support the antiquity of the man a for instance irenaeus and any one else that may have proclaim similar view papias give also in his own work other account of the word of the lord on the authority of aristion who be mention above and tradition a hand down by the presbyter john to which we refer those who be fond of learn but now we must add to the word of his which we have already quote the tradition which he give in regard to mark the author of the gospel it be in the follow word this also the presbyter say mark have become the interpreter of peter write down accurately though not indeed in order whatsoever he remember of the thing do or say by christ for he neither heard the lord nor follow him but afterward a i say he follow peter who adapt his teach to the need of his hearer but with no intention of give a connect account of the lord discourse so that mark commit no error while he thus write some thing a he remember them for he be careful of one thing not to omit any of the thing which he have heard and not to state any of them falsely these thing be related by papias concern mark but concern matthew he writes a follow so then matthew write the oracle in the hebrew language and every one interpret them a he be able and the same writer us testimony from the first epistle of john and from that of peter likewise and he relates another story of a woman who be accuse of many sin before the lord which be contain in the gospel accord to the hebrew these thing we have thought it necessary to observe in addition to what have already be state book chapter the bishop of rome and of alexandria during the reign of trajan about the twelfth year of the reign of trajan the abovementioned bishop of the parish of alexandria die and primus the fourth in succession from the apostle be chosen to the office at that time also alexander the fifth in the line of succession from peter and paul receive the episcopate at rome after evarestus have held the office eight year chapter the calamity of the jew during trajan reign the teach and the church of our saviour flourish greatly and make progress from day to day but the calamity of the jew increase and they underwent a constant succession of evil in the eighteenth year of trajan reign there be another disturbance of the jew through which a great multitude of them perish for in alexandria and in the rest of egypt and also in cyrene a if incite by some terrible and factious spirit they rush into seditious measure against their fellowinhabitants the greek the insurrection increase greatly and in the follow year while lupus be governor of all egypt it developed into a war of no mean magnitude in the first attack it happen that they be victorious over the greek who flee to alexandria and imprison and slew the jew that be in the city but the jew of cyrene although deprive of their aid continued to plunder the land of egypt and to devastate it district under the leadership of lucuas against them the emperor sent marcius turbo with a foot and naval force and also with a force of cavalry he carry on the war against them for a long time and fought many battle and slew many thousand of jew not only of those of cyrene but also of those who dwelt in egypt and have come to the assistance of their king lucuas but the emperor fear that the jew in mesopotamia would also make an attack upon the inhabitant of that country command lucius quintus to clear the province of them and he have march against them slew a great multitude of those who dwelt there and in consequence of his success he be make governor of judea by the emperor these event be record also in these very word by the greek historian that have write account of those time chapter the apologist that write in defense of the faith during the reign of adrian after trajan have reign for nineteen and a half year aelius adrian become his successor in the empire to him quadratus address a discourse contain an apology for our religion because certain wicked men have attempt to trouble the christian the work be still in the hand of a great many of the brother a also in our own and furnishes clear proof of the man understand and of his apostolic orthodoxy he himself reveals the early date at which he live in the follow word but the work of our savior be always present for they be genuine those that be heal and those that be raise from the dead who be see not only when they be heal and when they be raise but be also always present and not merely while the saviour be on earth but also after his death they be alive for quite a while so that some of them live even to our day such then be quadratus aristides also a believer earnestly devote to our religion left like quadratus an apology for the faith address to adrian his work too have be preserve even to the present day by a great many person chapter the bishop of rome and of alexandria under the same emperor in the third year of the same reign alexander bishop of rome die after hold office ten year his successor be xystus about the same time primus bishop of alexandria die in the twelfth year of his episcopate and be succeed by justus chapter the bishop of jerusalem from the age of our savior to the period under consideration the chronology of the bishop of jerusalem i have nowhere found preserve in write for tradition say that they be all short live but i have learn this much from writing that until the siege of the jew which take place under adrian there be fifteen bishop in succession there all of who be say to have be of hebrew descent and to have receive the knowledge of christ in purity so that they be approve by those who be able to judge such matter and be deem worthy of the episcopate for their whole church consist then of believe hebrew who continued from the day of the apostle until the siege which take place at this time in which siege the jew have again rebel against the roman be conquer after severe battle but since the bishop of the circumcision cease at this time it be proper to give here a list of their name from the begin the first then be james the socalled brother of the lord the second symeon the third justus the fourth zacchaeus the fifth tobias the sixth benjamin the seventh john the eighth matthias the ninth philip the tenth seneca the eleventh justus the twelfth levi the thirteenth ephres the fourteenth joseph and finally the fifteenth juda these be the bishop of jerusalem that live between the age of the apostle and the time refer to all of them belonging to the circumcision in the twelfth year of the reign of adrian xystus have complete the tenth year of his episcopate be succeed by telesphorus the seventh in succession from the apostle in the meantime after the lapse of a year and some month eumenes the sixth in order succeed to the leadership of the alexandrian church his predecessor have held office eleven year chapter the last siege of the jew under adrian a the rebellion of the jew at this time grow much more serious rufus governor of judea after an auxiliary force have be sent him by the emperor use their madness a a pretext proceed against them without mercy and destroyed indiscriminately thousand of men and woman and child and in accordance with the law of war reduce their country to a state of complete subjection the leader of the jew at this time be a man by the name of barcocheba which signifies a star who possess the character of a robber and a murderer but nevertheless rely upon his name boast to them a if they be slave that he possess wonderful power and he pretend that he be a star that have come down to them out of heaven to bring them light in the midst of their misfortune the war rag most fiercely in the eighteenth year of adrian at the city of bithara which be a very secure fortress situate not far from jerusalem when the siege have last a long time and the rebel have be driven to the last extremity by hunger and thirst and the instigator of the rebellion have suffer his just punishment the whole nation be prohibit from this time on by a decree and by the command of adrian from ever go up to the country about jerusalem for the emperor give order that they should not even see from a distance the land of their father such be the account of aristo of pella and thus when the city have be empty of the jewish nation and have suffer the total destruction of it ancient inhabitant it be colonize by a different race and the roman city which subsequently arose change it name and be call aelia in honor of the emperor aelius adrian and a the church there be now compose of gentile the first one to assume the government of it after the bishop of the circumcision be marcus chapter the person that become at that time leader of knowledge falsely socalled a the church throughout the world be now shin like the most brilliant star and faith in our savior and lord jesus christ be flourish among the whole human race the demon who hate everything that be good and be always hostile to the truth and most bitterly oppose to the salvation of man turn all his art against the church in the begin he arm himself against it with external persecution but now be shut off from the use of such mean he devise all sort of plan and employ other method in his conflict with the church use base and deceitful men a instrument for the ruin of soul and a minister of destruction instigate by him impostor and deceiver assume the name of our religion brought to the depth of ruin such of the believer a they could win over and at the same time by mean of the deed which they practice turn away from the path which lead to the word of salvation those who be ignorant of the faith accordingly there proceed from that menander whom we have already mention a the successor of simon a certain serpentlike power doubletongued and twoheaded which produce the leader of two different heresy saturninus an antiochian by birth and basilides an alexandrian the former of these establish school of godless heresy in syria the latter in alexandria irenaeus state that the false teach of saturninus agree in most respect with that of menander but that basilides under the pretext of unspeakable mystery invent monstrous fable and carry the fiction of his impious heresy quite beyond bound but a there be at that time a great many member of the church who be fight for the truth and defend apostolic and ecclesiastical doctrine with uncommon eloquence so there be some also that furnish posterity through their writing with mean of defense against the heresy to which we have refer of these there have come down to u a most powerful refutation of basilides by agrippa castor one of the most renowned writer of that day which show the terrible imposture of the man while expose his mystery he say that basilides write twentyfour book upon the gospel and that he invent prophet for himself name barcabbas and barcoph and others that have no existence and that he give them barbarous name in order to amaze those who marvel at such thing that he taught also that the eat of meat offer to idol and the unguarded renunciation of the faith in time of persecution be matter of indifference and that he enjoin upon his follower like pythagoras a silence of five year other similar thing the abovementioned writer have record concern basilides and have ably expose the error of his heresy irenaeus also writes that carpocrates be a contemporary of these men and that he be the father of another heresy call the heresy of the gnostic who do not wish to transmit any longer the magic art of simon a that one have do in secret but openly for they boast a of something great of love potion that be carefully prepared by them and of certain demon that sent them dream and lent them their protection and of other similar agency and in accordance with these thing they taught that it be necessary for those who wish to enter fully into their mystery or rather into their abomination to practice all the bad kind of wickedness on the ground that they could escape the cosmic power a they call them in no other way than by discharge their obligation to them all by infamous conduct thus it come to pas that the malignant demon make use of these minister on the one hand enslave those that be so pitiably lead astray by them to their own destruction while on the other hand he furnish to the unbelieving heathen abundant opportunity for slander the divine word inasmuch a the reputation of these men brought infamy upon the whole race of christian in this way therefore it come to pas that there be spread abroad in regard to u among the unbeliever of that age the infamous and most absurd suspicion that we practice unlawful commerce with mother and sister and enjoy impious feast he do not however long succeed in these artifice a the truth establish itself and in time shone with great brilliancy for the machination of it enemy be refute by it power and speedily vanished one new heresy arose after another and the former one always pass away and now at one time now at another now in one way now in other way be lose in idea of various kind and various form but the splendor of the catholic and only true church which be always the same grow in magnitude and power and reflect it piety and simplicity and freedom and the modesty and purity of it inspire life and philosophy to every nation both of greek and of barbarian at the same time the slanderous accusation which have be brought against the whole church also vanished and there remain our teach alone which have prevail over all and which be acknowledge to be superior to all in dignity and temperance and in divine and philosophical doctrine so that none of them now venture to affix a base calumny upon our faith or any such slander a our ancient enemy formerly delighted to utter nevertheless in those time the truth again call forth many champion who fought in it defense against the godless heresy refute them not only with oral but also with write argument chapter ecclesiastical writer among these hegesippus be well know we have already quote his word a number of time relate event which happen in the time of the apostle accord to his account he record in five book the true tradition of apostolic doctrine in a most simple style and he indicates the time in which he flourish when he writes a follow concern those that first set up idol to whom they erect cenotaph and temple a be do to the present day among whom be also antinous a slave of the emperor adrian in whose honor be celebrate also the antinoian game which be institute in our day for he ie adrian also found a city name after antinous and appoint prophet at the same time also justin a genuine lover of the true philosophy be still continue to busy himself with greek literature he indicates his time in the apology which he address to antonine where he writes a follow we do not think it out of place to mention here antinous also who live in our day and whom all be driven by fear to worship a a god although they knew who he be and whence he come the same writer speak of the jewish war which take place at that time add the follow for in the late jewish war barcocheba the leader of the jewish rebellion command that christian alone should be visit with terrible punishment unless they would deny and blaspheme jesus christ and in the same work he show that his conversion from greek philosophy to christianity be not without reason but that it be the result of deliberation on his part his word be a follow for i myself while i be delighted with the doctrine of plato and heard the christian slander and saw that they be afraid neither of death nor of anything else ordinarily look upon a terrible conclude that it be impossible that they could be living in wickedness and pleasure for what pleasureloving or intemperate man or what man that count it good to feast on human flesh could welcome death that he might be deprive of his enjoyment and would not rather strive to continue permanently his present life and to escape the notice of the ruler instead of give himself up to be put to death the same writer moreover relates that adrian have receive from serennius granianus a most distinguish governor a letter in behalf of the christian in which he state that it be not just to slay the christian without a regular accusation and trial merely for the sake of gratify the outcry of the populace sent a rescript to minucius fundanus proconsul of asia compound him to condemn no one without an indictment and a wellgrounded accusation and he give a copy of the epistle preserve the original latin in which it be write and preface it with the follow word although from the epistle of the great and most illustrious emperor adrian your father we have good ground to demand that you order judgment to be give a we have desire yet we have ask this not because it be order by adrian but rather because we know that what we ask be just and we have subjoin the copy of adrian epistle that you may know that we be speak the truth in this matter also and this be the copy after these word the author refer to give the rescript in latin which we have translate into greek a accurately a we could it read a follow chapter the epistle of adrian decree that we should not be punish without a trial to minucius fundanus i have receive an epistle write to me by serennius granianus a most illustrious man whom you have succeed it do not seem right to me that the matter should be pass by without examination l the men be harass and opportunity be give to the informer for practice villainy if therefore the inhabitant of the province can clearly sustain this petition against the christian so a to give answer in a court of law let them pursue this course alone but let them not have resort to men petition and outcry for it be far more proper if any one wish to make an accusation that you should examine into it if any one therefore accuses them and show that they be do anything contrary to the law do you pas judgment accord to the heinousness of the crime but by hercules if any one bring an accusation through mere calumny decide in regard to his criminality and see to it that you inflict punishment such be the content of adrian rescript chapter the bishop of rome and of alexandria during the reign of antoninus adrian have die after a reign of twentyone year be succeed in the government of the roman by antoninus call the pious in the first year of his reign telesphorus die in the eleventh year of his episcopate and hyginus become bishop of rome irenaeus record that telesphorus death be make glorious by martyrdom and in the same connection he state that in the time of the abovementioned roman bishop hyginus valentinus the founder of a sect of his own and cerdon the author of marcions error be both well know at rome he writes a follow chapter the heresiarchs of that age for valentinus come to rome under hyginus flourish under pius and remain until anicetus cerdon also marcions predecessor enter the church in the time of hyginus the ninth bishop and make confession and continued in this way now teach in secret now make confession again and now denounce for corrupt doctrine and withdraw from the assembly of the brother these word be found in the third book of the work against heresy and again in the first book he speaks a follow concern cerdon a certain cerdon who have take his system from the follower of simon and have come to rome under hyginus the ninth in the episcopal succession from the apostle taught that the god proclaim by the law and prophet be not the father of our lord jesus christ for the former be know but the latter unknown and the former be just but the latter good marcion of pontus succeed cerdon and developed his doctrine utter shameless blasphemy the same irenaeus unfolds with the great vigor the unfathomable abyss of valentinus error in regard to matter and reveals his wickedness secret and hidden like a serpent lurk in it nest and in addition to these men he say that there be also another that live in that age marcus by name who be remarkably skilled in magic art and he describes also their unholy initiation and their abominable mystery in the follow word for some of them prepare a nuptial couch and perform a mystic rite with certain form of expression address to those who be be initiate and they say that it be a spiritual marriage which be celebrate by them after the likeness of the marriage above but others lead them to water and while they baptize them they repeat the follow word into the name of the unknown father of the universe into truth the mother of all thing into the one that descend upon jesus others repeat hebrew name in order the well to confound those who be be initiate but hyginus have die at the close of the fourth year of his episcopate pius succeed him in the government of the church of rome in alexandria marcus be appoint pastor after eumenes have fill the office thirteen year in all and marcus have die after hold office ten year be succeed by celadion in the government of the church of alexandria and in rome pius die in the fifteenth year of his episcopate and anicetius assume the leadership of the christian there hegesippus record that he himself be in rome at this time and that he remain there until the episcopate of eleutherus but justin be especially prominent in those day in the guise of a philosopher he preach the divine word and contend for the faith in his writing he write also a work against marcion in which he state that the latter be alive at the time he write he speaks a follow and there be a certain marcion of pontus who be even now still teach his follower to think that there be some other god great than his creator and by the aid of the demon he have persuade many of every race of men to utter blasphemy and to deny that the maker of this universe be the father of christ and to confess that some other great than he be the creator and all who follow them be a we have say call christian just a the name of philosophy be give to philosopher although they may have no doctrine in common to this he add and we have also write a work against all the heresy that have exist which we will give you if you wish to read it but this same justin contend most successfully against the greek and address discourse contain an apology for our faith to the emperor antoninus call pius and to the roman senate for he live at rome but who and whence he be he show in his apology in the follow word chapter the apology of justin address to antoninus to the emperor titus aelius adrian antoninus pius caesar agustus and to verissimus his son the philosopher and to lucius the philosopher own son of caesar and adopt son of pius a lover of learn and to the sacred senate and to the whole roman people i justin son of priscus and grandson of bacchius of flavia neapolis in palestine syria present this address and petition in behalf of these men of every nation who be unjustly hat and persecute i myself be one of them and the same emperor have learn also from other brother in asia of the injury of all kind which they be suffer from the inhabitant of the province thought it proper to address the follow ordinance to the common assembly of asia chapter the epistle of antoninus to the common assembly of asia in regard to our doctrine the emperor caesar marcus aurelius antoninus agustus armenicus pontifex maximus for the fifteenth time tribune for the third time consul to the common assembly of asia greet i know that the god also take care that such person do not escape detection for they would much rather punish those who will not worship them than you would but you throw them into confusion and while you accuse them of atheism you only confirm them in the opinion which they hold it would indeed be more desirable for them when accuse to appear to die for their god than to live wherefore also they come off victorious when they give up their life rather than yield obedience to your command and in regard to the earthquake which have be and be still take place it be not improper to admonish you who lose heart whenever they occur and nevertheless be accustom to compare your conduct with theirs they indeed become the more confident in god while you during the whole time neglect in apparent ignorance the other god and the worship of the immortal and oppress and persecute even unto death the christian who worship him but in regard to these person many of the governor of the province write also to our most divine father to whom he write in reply that they should not trouble these people unless it should appear that they be attempt something affect the roman government and to me also many have sent communication concern these men but i have reply to them in the same way that my father do but if any one still persists in bring accusation against any of these people a such the person who be accuse shall be acquit of the charge even if it appear that he be one of them but the accuser shall be punish publish in ephesus in the common assembly of asia to these thing melito bishop of the church of sardis and a man well know at that time be a witness a be clear from his word in the apology which he address to the emperor verus on behalf of our doctrine chapter the circumstance related of polycarp a friend of the apostle at this time while anicetus be at the head of the church of rome irenaeus relates that polycarp who be still alive be at rome and that he have a conference with anicetus on a question concern the day of the paschal feast and the same writer give another account of polycarp which i feel constrain to add to that which have be already related in regard to him the account be take from the third book of irenaeus work against heresy and be a follow but polycarp also be not only instruct by apostle and acquaint with many that have see christ but be also appoint by apostle in asia bishop of the church of smyrna we too saw him in our early youth for he live a long time and die when a very old man a glorious and most illustrious martyr death have always taught the thing which he have learn from the apostle which the church also hand down and which alone be true to these thing all the asiatic church testify a do also those who down to the present time have succeed polycarp who be a much more trustworthy and certain witness of truth than valentinus and marcion and the rest of the heretic he also be in rome in the time of anicetus and cause many to turn away from the abovementioned heretic to the church of god proclaim that he have receive from the apostle this one and only system of truth which have be transmit by the church and there be those that heard from him that john the disciple of the lord go to bathe in ephesus and see cerinthus within ran out of the bathhouse without bathing cry let u flee l even the bath fall because cerinthus the enemy of the truth be within and polycarp himself when marcion once met him and say knowest thou u reply i know the first born of satan such caution do the apostle and their disciple exercise that they might not even converse with any of those who pervert the truth a paul also say a man that be a heretic after the first and second admonition reject know he that be such be subvert and sinneth be condemn of himself there be also a very powerful epistle of polycarp write to the philippeans from which those that wish to do so and that be concerned for their own salvation may learn the character of his faith and the preach of the truth such be the account of irenaeus but polycarp in his abovementioned epistle to the philippeans which be still extant have make use of certain testimony drawn from the first epistle of peter and when antoninus call pius have complete the twentysecond year of his reign marcus aurelius verus his son who be also call antoninus succeed him together with his brother licius chapter under verus polycarp with others suffer martyrdom at smyrna at this time when the great persecution be excite asia polycarp end his life by martyrdom but i consider it most important that his death a write account of which be still extant should be record in this history there be a letter write in the name of the church over which he himself preside to the parish in pontus which relates the event that befell him in the follow word the church of god which dwelleth at smyrna to the church of god which dwelleth in philomelium and to all the parish of the holy catholic church in every place mercy and peace and love from god the father and our lord jesus christ be multiply we write unto you brother an account of what happen to those that suffer martyrdom and to the bless polycarp who put an end to the persecution have a it be seal it by his martyrdom after these word before give the account of polycarp they record the event which befell the rest of the martyr and describe the great firmness which they exhibit in the midst of their pain for they say that the bystander be struck with amazement when they saw them lacerate with scourge even to the innermost vein and artery so that the hidden inward part of the body both their bowel and their member be expose to view and then laid upon seashell and certain point spit and subject to every specie of punishment and of torture and finally thrown a food to wild beast and they record that the most noble germanicus especially distinguish himself overcome by the grace of god the fear of bodily death implant by nature when indeed the proconsul wish to persuade him and urge his youth and besought him a he be very young and vigorous to take compassion on himself he do not hesitate but eagerly lure the beast toward himself all but compelling and irritate him in order that he might the sooner be freed from their unrighteous and lawless life after his glorious death the whole multitude marvel at the bravery of the godbeloved martyr and at the fortitude of the whole race of christian begin to cry out suddenly away with the atheist let polycarp be sought and when a very great tumult arose in consequence of the cry a certain phrygian quintus by name who be newly come from phrygia see the beast and the additional torture be smitten with cowardice and give up the attainment of salvation but the abovementioned epistle show that he too hastily and without proper discretion have rush forward with others to the tribunal but when seize have furnish a clear proof to all that it be not right for such person rashly and recklessly to expose themselves to danger thus do matter turn out in connection with them but the most admirable polycarp when he first heard of these thing continued undisturbed preserve a quiet and unshaken mind and determine to remain in the city but be persuade by his friend who entreat and exhort him to retire secretly he go out to a farm not far distant from the city and abode there with a few companion night and day do nothing but wrestle with the lord in prayer beseeching and implore and ask peace for the church throughout the whole world for this be always his custom and three day before his arrest while he be pray he saw in a vision at night the pillow under his head suddenly seize by fire and consume and upon this awaken he immediately interpret the vision to those that be present almost foretell that which be about to happen and declare plainly to those that be with him that it would be necessary for him for christ sake to die by fire then a those who be seek him push the search with vigor they say that he be again constrain by the solicitude and love of the brother to go to another farm thither his pursuer come after no long time and seize two of the servant there and torture one of them for the purpose of learn from him polycarp hidingplace and come late in the even they found him lie in an upper room whence he might have go to another house but he would not say the will of god be do and when he learn that they be present a the account say he go down and spoke to them with a very cheerful and gentle countenance so that those who do not already know the man thought that they beheld a miracle when they observe his advanced age and the gravity and firmness of his bearing and they marvel that so much effort should be make to capture a man like him but he do not hesitate but immediately give order that a table should be spread for them then he invite them to partake of a bounteous meal and ask of them one hour that he might pray undisturbed and when they have give permission he stood up and prayed be full of the grace of the lord so that those who be present and heard him pray be amaze and many of them now repent that such a venerable and godly old man be about to be put to death in addition to these thing the narrative concern him contains the follow account but when at length he have brought his prayer to an end after remember all that have ever come into contact with him small and great famous and obscure and the whole catholic church throughout the world the hour of departure be come they put him upon an as and brought him to the city it be a great sabbath and he be met by herod the captain of police and by his father nicetes who take him into their carriage and sit beside him endeavor to persuade him say for what harm be there in say lord caesar and sacrifice and save your life he at first do not answer but when they persist he say i be not go to do what you advise me and when they fail to persuade him they uttered dreadful word and thrust him down with violence so that a he descend from the carriage he lacerate his shin but without turn round he go on his way promptly and rapidly a if nothing have happen to him and be take to the stadium but there be such a tumult in the stadium that not many heard a voice from heaven which come to polycarp a he be enter the place be strong polycarp and play the man and no one saw the speaker but many of our people heard the voice and when he be lead forward there be a great tumult a they heard that polycarp be take finally when he come up the proconsul ask if he be polycarp and when he confess that he be he endeavor to persuade him to deny say have regard for thine age and other like thing which it be their custom to say swear by the genius of caesar repent and say away with the atheist but polycarp look with dignify countenance upon the whole crowd that be gather in the stadium wave his hand to them and groan and raise his eye toward heaven say away with the atheist but when the magistrate press him and say swear and i will release thee revile christ polycarp say fourscore and six year have i be serve him and he hath do me no wrong how then can i blaspheme my king who save me but when he again persist and say swear by the genius of caesar polycarp reply if thou vainly supposest that i will swear by the genius of caesar a thou sayest feign to be ignorant who i be hear plainly i be a christian but if thou desirest to learn the doctrine of christianity assign a day and hear the proconsul say persuade the people but polycarp say a for thee i thought thee worthy of an explanation for we have be taught to render to prince and authority ordain by god the honor that be due so long a it do not injure u but a for these i do not esteem them the proper person to whom to make my defense but the proconsul say i have wild beast i will throw thee to them unless thou repent but he say call them for repentance from well to bad be a change we can not make but it be a noble thing to turn from wickedness to righteousness but he again say to him if thou despisest the wild beast i will cause thee to be consume by fire unless thou repent but polycarp say thou threatenest a fire which burneth for an hour and after a little be quenched for thou knowest not the fire of the future judgment and of the eternal punishment which be reserve for the impious but why dost thou delay do what thou wilt say these and other word besides he be fill with courage and joy and his face be suffuse with grace so that not only be he not terrify and dismayed by the word that be spoken to him but on the contrary the proconsul be amaze and sent his herald to proclaim three time in the midst of the stadium polycarp hath confess that he be a christian and when this be proclaim by the herald the whole multitude both of gentile and of jew who dwelt in smyrna cry out with ungovernable wrath and with a great shout this be the teacher of asia the father of the christian the overthrower of our god who teacheth many not to sacrifice nor to worship when they have say this they cry out and ask the asiarch philip to let a lion loose upon polycarp but he say that it be not lawful for him since he have close the game then they thought fit to cry out with one accord that polycarp should be burn alive for it be necessary that the vision should be fulfil which have be show him concern his pillow when he saw it burning while he be pray and turn and say prophetically to the faithful that be with him i must need be burn alive these thing be do with great speed more quickly than they be say the crowd immediately collect from the workshop and bath timber and fagot the jew be especially zealous in the work a be their wont but when the pile be ready take off all his upper garment and loose his girdle he attempt also to remove his shoe although he have never before do this because of the effort which each of the faithful always make to touch his skin first for he have be treat with all honor on account of his virtuous life even before his gray hair come forthwith then the material prepared for the pile be place about him and a they be also about to nail him to the stake he say leave me thus for he who hath give me strength to endure the fire will also grant me strength to remain in the fire unmoved without be secure by you with nail so they do not nail him but bound him and he with his hand behind him and bound like a noble ram take from a great flock an acceptable burntoffering unto god omnipotent say father of thy beloved and bless son jesus christ through whom we have receive the knowledge of thee the god of angel and of power and of the whole creation and of the entire race of the righteous who live in thy presence i bless thee that thou hast deem me worthy of this day and hour that i might receive a portion in the number of the martyr in the cup of christ unto resurrection of eternal life both of soul and of body in the immortality of the holy spirit among these may i be receive before thee this day in a rich and acceptable sacrifice a thou the faithful and true god bast beforehand prepared and reveal and hast fulfil wherefore i praise thee also for everything i bless thee i glorify thee through the eternal high priest jesus christ thy beloved son through whom with him in the holy spirit be glory unto thee both now and for the age to come amen when he have offer up his amen and have finish his prayer the fireman light the fire and a a great flame blaze out we to whom it be give to see saw a wonder and we be preserve that we might relate what happen to the others for the fire present the appearance of a vault like the sail of a vessel fill by the wind and make a wall about the body of the martyr and it be in the midst not like flesh burning but like gold and silver refine in a furnace for we perceive such a fragrant odor a of the fume of frankincense or of some other precious spice so at length the lawless men when they saw that the body could not be consume by the fire command an executioner to approach and pierce him with the sword and when he have do this there come forth a quantity of blood so that it extinguish the fire and the whole crowd marvel that there should be such a difference between the unbeliever and the elect of whom this man also be one the most wonderful teacher in our time apostolic and prophetic who be bishop of the catholic church in smyrna for every word which come from his mouth be accomplish and will be accomplish but the jealous and envious evil one the adversary of the race of the righteous when he saw the greatness of his martyrdom and his blameless life from the begin and when he saw him crown with the crown of immortality and bearing off an incontestable prize take care that not even his body should be take away by u although many desire to do it and to have communion with his holy flesh accordingly certain one secretly suggest to nicetes the father of herod and brother of alce that he should plead with the magistrate not to give up his body l it be say they should abandon the crucify one and begin to worship this man they say these thing at the suggestion and impulse of the jew who also watch a we be about to take it from the fire not know that we shall never be able either to forsake christ who suffer for the salvation of the whole world of those that be save or to worship any other for we worship him who be the son of god but the martyr a disciple and imitator of the lord we love a they deserve on account of their matchless affection for their own king and teacher may we also be make partaker and fellowdisciples with them the centurion therefore when he saw the contentiousness exhibit by the jew place him in the midst and burn him a be their custom and so we afterwards gather up his bone which be more valuable than precious stone and more to be esteem than gold and laid them in a suitable place there the lord will permit u to come together a we be able in gladness and joy to celebrate the birthday of his martyrdom for the commemoration of those who have already fought and for the training and preparation of those who shall hereafter do the same such be the event that befell the bless polycarp who suffer martyrdom in smyrna with the eleven from philadelphia this one man be remember more than the others by all so that even by the heathen he be talk about in every place of such an end be the admirable and apostolic polycarp deem worthy a record by the brother of the church of smyrna in their epistle which we have mention in the same volume concern him be subjoin also other martyrdom which take place in the same city smyrna about the same period of time with polycarp martyrdom among them also metrodorus who appear to have be a proselyte of the marcionitic sect suffer death by fire a celebrate martyr of those time be a certain man name pionius those who desire to know his several confession and the boldness of his speech and his apology in behalf of the faith before the people and the ruler and his instructive address and moreover his greeting to those who have yield to temptation in the persecution and the word of encouragement which he address to the brother who come to visit him in prison and the torture which he endure in addition and besides these the suffering and the nailings and his firmness on the pile and his death after all the extraordinary trial those we refer to that epistle which have be give in the martyrdom of the ancient collect by u and which contains a very full account of him and there be also record extant of others that suffer martyrdom in pergamus a city of asia of carpus and papylus and a woman name agathonice who after many and illustrious testimony gloriously end their life chapter justin the philosopher preaches the word of christ in rome and suffers martyrdom about this time justin who be mention by u just above after he have address a second work in behalf of our doctrine to the ruler already name be crown with divine martyrdom in consequence of a plot laid against him by crescens a philosopher who emulate the life and manner of the cynic whose name he bore after justin have frequently refute him in public discussion he won by his martyrdom the prize of victory die in behalf of the truth which he preach and he himself a man most learn in the truth in his apology already refer to clearly predicts how this be about to happen to him although it have not yet occur his word be a follow i too there fore expect to be plot against and put in the stock by some one of those whom i have name or perhaps by crescens that unphilosophical and vainglorious man for the man be not worthy to be call a philosopher who publicly bear witness against those concern whom he know nothing declare for the sake of captivate and please the multitude that the christian be atheistical and impious do this he errs greatly for if he assails u without have read the teaching of christ he be thoroughly deprave and be much bad than the illiterate who often guard against discuss and bearing false witness about matter which they do not understand and if he have read them and do not understand the majesty that be in them or understand it do these thing in order that he may not be suspect of be an adherent he be far more base and totally deprave be enslave to vulgar applause and irrational fear for i would have you know that when i propose certain question of the sort and ask him in regard to them i learn and prove that he indeed know nothing and to show that i speak the truth i be ready if these disputation have not be report to you to discus the question again in your presence and this indeed would be an act worthy of an emperor but if my question and his answer have be make know to you it be obvious to you that he know nothing about our affair or if he know but do not dare to speak because of those who hear him he show himself to be a i have already say not a philosopher but a vainglorious man who indeed do not even regard that most admirable say of socrates these be the word of justin and that he met his death a he have predict that he would in consequence of the machination of crescens be state by tatian a than who early in life lecture upon the science of the greek and won no little fame in them and who have left a great many monument of himself in his writing he record this fact in his work against the greek where he writes a follow and that most admirable justin declare with truth that the aforesaid person be like robber then after make some remark about the philosopher he continue a follow crescens indeed who make his nest in the great city surpass all in his unnatural lust and be wholly devote to the love of money and he who taught that death should be despise be himself so greatly in fear of it that he endeavor to inflict death a if it be a great evil upon justin because the latter when preach the truth have prove that the philosopher be glutton and impostor and such be the cause of justins martyrdom chapter the martyr whom justin intention in his own work the same man before his conflict mention in his first apology others that suffer martyrdom before him and most fittingly record the follow event he writes thus a certain woman live with a dissolute husband she herself too have formerly be of the same character but when she come to the knowledge of the teaching of christ she become temperate and endeavor to persuade her husband likewise to be temperate repeat the teaching and declare the punishment in eternal fire which shall come upon those who do not live temperately and conformably to right reason but he continue in the same excess alienate his wife by his conduct for she finally think it wrong to live a a wife with a man who contrary to the law of nature and right sought every possible mean of pleasure desire to be divorce from him and when she be earnestly entreat by her friend who counsel her still to remain with him on the ground that her husband might some time give hope of amendment she do violence to herself and remain but when her husband have go to alexandria and be report to be conduct himself still bad she in order that she might not by continue in wedlock and by share his board and bed become a partaker in his lawlessness and impiety give him what we a call a bill of divorce and left him but her noble and excellent husband instead of rejoice a he ought to have do that she have give up those action which she have formerly recklessly commit with the servant and hireling when she delighted in drunkenness and in every vice and that she desire him likewise to give them up when she have go from him contrary to his wish brought an accusation concern her declare that she be a christian and she petition you the emperor that she might be permit first to set her affair in order and afterwards after the settlement of her affair to make her defense against the accusation and this you grant but he who have once be her husband be no longer able to prosecute her direct his attack against a certain ptolemaeus who have be her teacher in the doctrine of christianity and whom urbicius have punish against him he proceed in the follow manner he persuade a centurion who be his friend to cast ptolemaeus into prison and to take him and ask him this only whether he be a christian and when ptolemaeus who be a lover of truth and not of a deceitful and false disposition confess that he be a christian the centurion bound him and punish him for a long time in the prison and finally when the man be brought before urbicius he be likewise ask this question only whether he be a christian and again conscious of the benefit which he enjoy through the teach of christ he confess his school in divine virtue for whoever denies that he be a christian either denies because he despises christianity or he avoids confession because he be conscious that he be unworthy and an alien to it neither of which be the case with the true christian and when urbicius command that he be lead away to punishment a certain lucius who be also a christian see judgment so unjustly pass say to urbicius why have you punish this i man who be not an adulterer nor a fornicator nor a murderer nor a thief nor a robber nor have be convict of commit any crime at all but have confess that he beam the name of christian you do not judge o urbicius in a manner befit the emperor pin or the philosophical son of caesar or the sacred senate and without make any other reply he say to lucius thou also seemest to me to be such an one and when lucius say certainly he again command that he too should be lead away to punishment but he profess his thanks for he be liberate he add from such wicked ruler and be go to the good father and king god and still a third have come forward be condemn to be punish to this justin fittingly and consistently add the word which we quote above say i too therefore expect to be plot against by some one of those whom i have name etc chapter the work of justin which have come down to u this writer have left u a great many monument of a mind educate and practice in divine thing which be replete with profitable matter of every kind to them we shall refer the studious note a we proceed those that have come to our knowledge there be a certain discourse of his in defense of our doctrine address to antoninus surnamed the pious and to his son and to the roman senate another work contains his second apology in behalf of our faith which he offer to him who be the successor of the emperor mention and who bore the same name antoninus verus the one whose time we be now record also another work against the greek in which he discourse at length upon most of the question at issue between u and the greek philosopher and discus the nature of demon it be not necessary for me to add any of these thing here and still another work of his against the greek have come down to u to which he give the title refutation and besides these another on the sovereignty of god which he establishes not only from our scripture but also from the book of the greek still far a work entitle psaltes and another disputation on the soul in which after propound various question concern the problem under discussion he give the opinion of the greek philosopher promising to refute it and to present his own view in another work he compose also a dialogue against the jew which he held in the city of ephesus with trypho a most distinguish man among the hebrew of that day in it he show how the divine grace urge him on to the doctrine of the faith and with what earnestness he have formerly pursue philosophical study and how ardent a search he have make for the truth and he record of the jew in the same work that they be plot against the teach of christ assert the same thing against trypho not only do you not repent of the wickedness which you have commit but you select at that time chosen men and you sent them out from jerusalem through all the land to announce that the godless heresy of the christian have make it appearance and to accuse them of those thing which all that be ignorant of u say against u so that you become the cause not only of your own injustice but also of all other men he writes also that even down to his time prophetic gift shone in the church and he mention the apocalypse of john say distinctly that it be the apostle he also refers to certain prophetic declaration and accuses trypho on the ground that the jew have cut them out of the scripture a great many other work of his be still in the hand of many of the brother and the discourse of the man be thought so worthy of study even by the ancient that irenaeus quote his word for instance in the fourth book of his work against heresy where he writes a follow and justin well say in his work against marcion that he would not have believe the lord himself if he have preach another god besides the creator and again in the fifth book of the same work he say and justin well say that before the come of the lord satan never dare to blaspheme god because he do not yet know his condemnation these thing i have deem it necessary to say for the sake of stimulate the studious to peruse his work with diligence so much concern him chapter the ruler of the church of rome and alexandria during the reign of fern in the eighth year of the abovementioned reign soter succeed anicetus a bishop of the church of rome after the latter have held office eleven year in all but when celadion have preside over the church of alexandria for fourteen year tie be succeed by agrippinus chapter the ruler of the church of antioch at that time also in the church of antioch theophilus be well know a the sixth from the apostle for cornelius who succeed hero be the fourth and after him eros the fifth in order have held the office of bishop chapter the ecclesiastical writer that flourish in those day at that time there flourish in the church hegesippus whom we know from what have go before and dionysius bishop of corinth and another bishop pinytus of crete and besides these philip and apolinarius and melito and musanus and modestus and finally irenaeus from them have come down to u in write the sound and orthodox faith receive from apostolic tradition chapter hegesippus and the event which he mention hegesippus in the five book of memoir which have come down to u have left a most complete record of his own view in them he state that on a journey to rome he met a great many bishop and that he receive the same doctrine from all it be fitting to hear what he say after make some remark about the epistle of clement to the corinthian his word be a follow and the church in of corinth continued in the true faith until primus be bishop in corinth i converse with them on my way to rome and abode with the corinthian many day during which we be mutually refresh in the true doctrine and when i have come to rome i remain a there until anicetus whose deacon be eleutherus and anicetus be succeed by soter and he by eleutherus in every succession and in every city that be held which be preach by the law and the prophet and the lord the same author also describes the beginning of the heresy which arose in his time in the follow word and after james the just have suffer martyrdom a the lord have also on the same account symeon the son of the lord uncle clopas be appoint the next bishop all propose him a second bishop because he be a cousin of the lord therefore they call the church a virgin for it be not yet corrupt by vain discourse but thebuthis because he be not make bishop begin to corrupt it he also be sprung from the seven sect among the people like simon from whom come the simonians and cleobius from whom come the cleobians and dositheus from whom come the dositheans and gorthaeus from whom come the goratheni and masbotheus from whom come the masbothaeans from them sprang the menandrianists and marcionists and carpocratians and valentinians and basilidians and saturnilians each introduce privately and separately his own peculiar opinion from them come false christ false prophet false apostle who divide the unity of the church by corrupt doctrine uttered against god and against his christ the same writer also record the ancient heresy which arose among the jew in the follow word there be moreover various opinion in the circumcision among the child of israel the follow be those that be oppose to the tribe of judah and the christ essene galilean hemerobaptists masbothaeans samaritan sadducee pharisee and he write of many other matter which we have in part already mention introduce the account in their appropriate place and from the syriac gospel accord to the hebrew he quote some passage in the hebrew tongue show that he be a convert from the hebrew and he mention other matter a take from the unwritten tradition of the jew and not only he but also irenaeus and the whole company of the ancient call the proverb of solomon allvirtuous wisdom and when speak of the book call apocrypha he record that some of them be compose in his day by certain heretic but let u now pas on to another chapter dionysius bishop of corinth and the epistle which he write and first we must speak of dionysius who be appoint bishop of the church in corinth and communicate freely of his inspire labor not only to his own people but also to those in foreign land and render the great service to all in the catholic epistle which he write to the church among these be the one address to the lacedaemonians contain instruction in the orthodox faith and an admonition to peace and unity the one also address to the athenian excite them to faith and to the life prescribed by the gospel which he accuses them of

greatness and splendor to this power thou hast succeed a the desire possessor and such shalt thou continue with thy son if thou guardest the philosophy which grow up with the empire and which come into existence with augustus that philosophy which thy ancestor also honor along with the other religion and a most convincing proof that our doctrine flourish for the good of an empire happily begin be this that there have no evil happen since augustus reign but that on the contrary all thing have be splendid and glorious in accordance with the prayer of all nero and domitian alone persuade by certain calumniators have wish to slander our doctrine and from them it have come to pas that the falsehood have be hand down in consequence of an unreasonable practice which prevails of bring

afterwards come out with it innovation but at that time be a it be in it incipiency since montanus with his false prophetess be then lay the foundation of his error chapter musanus and his writing and a for musanus whom we have mention among the forego writer a certain very elegant discourse be extant which be write by him against some brother that have go over to the heresy of the socalled encratites which have recently sprung up and which introduce a strange and pernicious error it be say that tatian be the author of this false doctrine chapter the heresy of tatian he be the one whose word we quote a little above in regard to that admirable man justin and whom we state to have be a disciple of the martyr irenaeus declares this in the first book of his work against heresy where he writes a follow concern both him and his heresy those who be call encratites and who sprung from saturninus and marcion preach celibacy set aside the original arrangement of god and tacitly censure him who make male and female for the propagation of the human race they introduce also abstinence from the thing call by them animate thus show ingratitude to the god who make all thing and they deny the salvation of the first man but this have be only recently discover by them a certain tatian be the first to introduce this blasphemy he be a hearer of justin and express no such opinion while he be with him but after the martyrdom of the latter he left the church and become exalt with the thought of be a teacher and puffed up with the idea that he be superior to others he establish a peculiar type of doctrine of his own invent certain invisible aeon like the follower of valentinus while like marcion and saturninus he pronounce marriage to be corruption and fornication his argument against the salvation of adam however he devise for himself irenaeus at that time write thus but a little later a certain man name severus put new strength into the aforesaid heresy and thus brought it about that those who take their origin from it be call after him severians they indeed use the law and prophet and gospel but interpret in their own way the utterance of the sacred scripture and they abuse paul the apostle and reject his epistle and do not accept even the act of the apostle but their original founder tatian form a certain combination and collection of the gospel i know not how to which he give the title diatessaron and which be still in the l hand of some but they say that he venture to paraphrase certain word of the apostle in order to improve their style he have left a great many writing of these the one most in use among many person be his celebrate address to the greek which also appear to be the best and most useful of all his work in it he deal with the most ancient time and show that moses and the hebrew prophet be old than all the celebrate men among the greek so much in regard to these men chapter bardesanes the syrian and his extant work in the same reign a heresy be abound in the region between the river a certain bardesanes a most able man and a most skillful disputant in the syriac tongue have compose dialogue against marcions follower and against certain others who be author of various opinion commit them to write in his own language together with many other work his pupil of whom he have very many for he be a powerful defender of the faith translate these production from the syriac into greek among them there be also his most able dialogue on fate address to antoninus and other work which they say he write on occasion of the persecution which arose at that time he indeed be at first a follower of valentinus but afterward have reject his teach and have refute most of his fiction he fancy that he have come over to the more correct opinion nevertheless he do not entirely wash off the filth of the old heresy about this time also soter bishop of the church of rome depart this life book v introduction soter bishop of the church of rome die

for posterity and in truth it be worthy of perpetual remembrance a full account contain the most reliable information on the subject be give in our collection of martyrdom which constitutes a narrative instructive a well a historical i will repeat here such portion of this account a may be needful for the present purpose other writer of history record the victory of war and trophy won from enemy the skill of general and the manly bravery of soldier defile with blood and with innumerable slaughter for the sake of child and country and other possession but our narrative of the government of god will record in ineffaceable letter the most peaceful war wag in behalf of the peace of the soul and will tell of men do brave deed for truth rather than country and for piety rather than dearest friend it will hand down to imperishable remembrance the discipline and the muchtried fortitude of the athlete of religion the trophy won from demon the victory over invisible enemy and the crown place upon all their head chapter the number of those who fought for religion in gaul under verus and the nature of their conflict the country in which the arena be pre par for them be gaul of which lyon and vienne be the principal and most celebrate city the rhone pass through both of them flow in a broad stream through the entire region the most celebrate church in that country sent an account of the witness to the church in asia and phrygia relate in the follow manner what be do among them i will give their own word the servant of christ reside at vienne and lyon in gaul to the brother through out asia and phrygia who hold the same faith and hope of redemption peace and grace and glory from god the father and christ jesus our lord then have related some other matter they begin their account in this manner the greatness of the tribulation in this region and the fury of the heathen against the saint and the suffering of the bless witness we can not recount accurately nor indeed could they possibly be record for with all his might the adversary fell upon u give u a foretaste of his unbridled activity at his future come he endeavor in every manner to practice and exercise his servant against the servant of god not only shut u out from house and bath and market but forbid any of u to be see in any place whatever but the grace of god lead the conflict against him and deliver the weak and set them a firm pillar able through patience to endure all the wrath of the evil one and they join battle with him undergo all kind of shame and injury and regard their great suffering a little they hasten to christ manifest truly that the suffering of this present time be not worthy to be compare with the glory which shall be reveal to usward first of all they endure nobly the injury heaped upon them by the populace clamor and blow and draggings and robbery and stoning and imprisonment and all thing which an infuriate mob delight in inflict on enemy and adversary then be take to the forum by the chiliarch and the authority of the city they be examine in the presence of the whole multitude and have confess they be imprison until the arrival of the governor when afterwards they be brought before him and he treat u with the utmost cruelty vettius epagathus one of the brother and a man fill with love for god and his neighbor interfere his life be so consistent that although young he have attain a reputation equal to that of the eider zacharias for he walk in all the commandment and ordinance of the lord blameless s and be untiring in every good work for his neighbor zealous for god and fervent in spirit such be his character he could not endure the unreasonable judgment against u but be fill with indignation and ask to be permit to testify in behalf of his brother that there be among u nothing ungodly or impious but those about the judgment seat cry out against him for he be a man of distinction and the governor refuse to grant his just request and merely ask if he also be a christian and he confess this with a loud voice be himself take into the order of the witness be call the advocate of the christian but have the advocate in himself the spirit more abundantly than zacharias he show this by the fullness of his love be well pleased even to lay down his life in defense of the brother for he be and be a true disciple of christ follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth then the others be divide and the protowitnesses be manifestly ready and finish their confession with all eagerness but some appear unprepared and untrained weak a yet and unable to endure so great a conflict about ten of these prove abortion cause u great grief and sorrow beyond measure and impair the zeal of the others who have not yet be seize but who though suffer all kind of affliction continued constantly with the witness and do not forsake them then all of u fear greatly on account of uncertainty a to their confession not because we dread the suffering to be endure but because we look to the end and be afraid that some of them might fall away but those who be worthy be seize day by day fill up their number so that all the zealous person and those through whom especially our affair have be establish be collect together out of the two church and some of our heathen servant also be seize a the governor have command that all of u should be examine publicly these be ensnare by satan and fear for themselves the torture which they beheld the saint endure and be also urge on by the soldier accuse u falsely of thyestean banquet and edipodean intercourse and of deed which be not only unlawful for u to speak of or to think but which we can not believe be ever do by men when these accusation be report all the people rag like wild beast against u so that even if any have before be moderate on account of friendship they be now exceedingly furious and gnash their teeth against u and that which be spoken by our lord be fulfil the time will come when whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service then finally the holy witness endure suffering beyond description satan strive earnestly that some of the slander might be uttered by them also but the whole wrath of the populace and governor and soldier be arouse exceedingly against sanctus the deacon from vienne and maturus a late convert yet a noble combatant and against attalus a native of pergamos where he have always be a pillar and foundation and blandina through whom christ show that thing which appear mean and obscure and despicable to men be with god of great glory through love toward him manifest in power and not boasting in appearance for while we all tremble and her earthly mistress who be herself also one of the witness fear that on account of the weakness of her body she would be unable to make bold confession blandina be fill with such power a to be deliver and raise above those who be torture her by turn from morning till even in every manner so that they acknowledge that they be conquer and could do nothing more to her and they be astonish at her endurance a her entire body be mangle and broken and they testify that one of these form of torture be sufficient to destroy life not to speak of so many and so great suffering but the bless woman like a noble athlete renew her strength in her confession and her comfort and recreation and relief from the pain of her suffering be in exclaim i be a christian and there be nothing vile do by u but sanctus also endure marvelously and superhumanly all the outrage which he suffer while the wicked men hop by the continuance and severity of his torture to wring something from him which he ought not to say he gird himself against them with such firmness that he would not even tell his name or the nation or city to which he belong or whether he be bond or free but answer in the roman tongue to all their question i be a christian he confess this instead of name and city and race and everything besides and the people heard from him no other word there arose therefore on the part of the governor and his tormentor a great desire to conquer him but have nothing more that they could do to him they finally fasten redhot brazen plate to the most tender part of his body and these indeed be burn but he continued unbend and unyielding firm in his confession and refresh and strengthen by the heavenly fountain of the water of life flow from the bowel of christ and his body be a witness of his suffering be one complete wound and bruise drawn out of shape and altogether unlike a human form christ suffer in him manifest his glory deliver him from his adversary and make him an example for the others show that nothing be fearful where the love of the father be and nothing painful where there be the glory of christ for when the wicked men torture him a second time after some day suppose that with his body swollen and inflame to such a degree that he could not bear the touch of a hand if they should again apply the same instrument they would overcome him or at least by his death under his suffering others would be make afraid not only do not this occur but contrary to all human expectation his body arose and stood erect in the midst of the subsequent torment and resume it original appearance and the use of it limb so that through the grace of christ these second suffering become to him not torture but heal but the devil think that he have already consume biblias who be one of those who have deny christ desire to increase her condemnation through the utterance of blasphemy brought her again to the torture to compel her a already feeble and weak to report impious thing concern u but she recover herself under the suffer and a if awake from a deep sleep and remind by the present anguish of the eternal punishment in hell she contradict the blasphemer how she say could those eat child who do not think it lawful to taste the blood even of irrational animal and thenceforward she confess herself a christian and be give a place in the order of the witness but a the tyrannical torture be make by christ of none effect through the patience of the bless the devil invent other contrivance confinement in the dark and most loathsome part of the prison stretch of the foot to the fifth hole in the stock and the other outrage which his servant be accustom to inflict upon the prisoner when furious and fill with the devil a great many be suffocate in prison be chosen by the lord for this manner of death that he might manifest in them his glory for some though they have be torture so cruelly that it seem impossible that they could live even with the most careful nursing yet destitute of human attention remain in the prison be strengthen by the lord and invigorate both in body and soul and they exhort and encourage the rest but such a be young and arrest recently so that their body have not become accustom to torture be unable to endure the severity of their confinement and die in prison the bless pothinus who have be entrust with the bishopric of lyon be drag to the judgment seat he be more than ninety year of age and very infirm scarcely indeed able to breathe because of physical weakness but he be strengthen by spiritual zeal through his earnest desire for martyrdom though his body be worn out by old age and disease his life be preserve that christ might triumph in it when he be brought by the soldier to the tribunal accompany by the civil magistrate and a multitude who shout against him m every manner a if he be christ himself he bore noble witness be ask by the governor who be the god of the christian he reply if thou art worthy thou shalt know then he be drag away harshly and receive blow of every kind those near him struck him with their hand and foot regardless of his age and those at a distance hurl at him whatever they could seize all of them think that they would be guilty of great wickedness and impiety if any possible abuse be omit for thus they thought to avenge their own deity scarcely able to breathe he be cast into prison and die after two day then a certain great dispensation of god occur and the compassion of jesus appear beyond measure in a manner rarely see among the brotherhood but not beyond the power of christ for those who have recant at their first arrest be imprison with the others and endure terrible suffering so that their denial be of no profit to them even for the present but those who confess what they be imprison a christian no other accusation be brought against them but the first be treat afterwards a murderer and defile and be punish twice a severely a the others for the joy of martyrdom and the hope of the promise and love for christ and the spirit of the father support the latter but their conscience so greatly distressed the former that they be easily distinguishable from all the rest by their very countenance when they be lead forth for the first go out rejoice glory and grace be blend in their face so that even their bond seem like beautiful ornament a those of a bride adorn with variegate golden fringe and they be perfume with the sweet savor of christ so that some suppose they have be anoint with earthly ointment but the others be downcast and humble and deject and fill with every kind of disgrace and they be reproach by the heathen a ignoble and weak bearing the accusation of murderer and have lose the one honorable and glorious and lifegiving name the rest beholding this be strengthen and when apprehend they confess without hesitation pay no attention to the persuasion of the devil after certain other word they continue after these thing finally their martyrdomswere divide into every form for plait a crown of various color and of all kind of flower they present it to the father it be proper therefore that the noble athlete have endure a manifold strife and conquer grandly should receive the crown great and incorruptible maturus therefore and sanctus and blandina and attalus be lead to the amphitheater to be expose to the wild beast and to give to the heathen public a spectacle of cruelty a day for fight with wild beast be specially appoint on account of our people both maturus and sanctus pass again through every torment in the amphitheater a if they have suffer nothing before or rather a if have already conquer their antagonist in many contest they be now strive for the crown itself they endure again the customary run of the gauntlet and the violence of the wild beast and everything which the furious people call for or desire and at last the iron chair in which their body be roast torment them with the fume and not with this do the persecutor cease but be yet more mad against them determine to overcome their patience but even thus they do not hear a word from sanctus except the confession which he have uttered from the begin these then after their life have continued for a long time through the great conflict be at last sacrifice have be make throughout that day a spectacle to the world in place of the usual variety of combat but blandina be suspend on a stake and expose to be devour by the wild beast who should attack her and because she appear a if hang on a cross and because of her earnest prayer she inspire the combatant with great zeal for they look on her in her conflict and beheld with their outward eye in the form of their sister him who be crucify for them that he might persuade those who believe on him that every one who suffers for the glory of christ have fellowship always with the living god a none of the wild beast at that time touch her she be take down from the stake and cast again into prison she be preserve thus for another contest that be victorious in more conflict she might make the punishment of the crooked serpent irrevocable and though small and weak and despise yet clothed with christ the mighty and conquer athlete she might arouse the zeal of the brother and have overcome the adversary many time might receive through her conflict the crown incorruptible but attalus be call for loudly by the people because he be a person of distinction he enter the contest readily on account of a good conscience and his genuine practice in christian discipline and a he have always be a witness for the truth among u he be lead around the amphitheater a tablet be carry before him on which be write in the roman language this be attalus the christian and the people be fill with indignation against him but when the governor learn that he be a roman he command him to be take back with the rest of those who be in prison concern whom he have write to caesar and whose answer he be await but the intervene time be not waste nor fruitless to them for by their patience the measureless compassion of christ be manifest for through their continued life the dead be make alive and the witness show favor to those who have fail to witness and the virgin mother have much joy in receive alive those whom she have brought forth a dead for through their influence many who have deny be restore and rebegotten and rekindle with life and learn to confess and be make alive and strengthen they go to the judgment seat to be again interrogate by the governor god who desire not the death of the sinner but mercifully invite to repentance treat them with kindness for caesar command that they should be put to death but that any who might deny should be set free therefore at the begin of the public festival which take place there and which be attend by crowd of men from all nation the governor brought the bless one to the judgment seat to make of them a show and spectacle for the multitude wherefore also he examine them again and behead those who appear to posse roman citizenship but he sent the others to the wild beast and christ be glorify greatly in those who have formerly deny him for contrary to the expectation of the heathen they confess for they be examine by themselves a about to be set free but confess they be add to the order of the witness but some continued without who have never possess a trace of faith nor any apprehension of the wedding garment nor an understand of the fear of god but a son of perdition they blaspheme the way through their apostasy but all the others be add to the church while these be be examine a certain alexander a phrygian by birth and physician by profession who have reside in gaul for many year and be well know to all on account of his love to god and boldness of speech for he be not without a share of apostolic grace stand before the judgment seat and by sign encourage them to confess appear to those stand by a if in travail but the people be enrage because those who formerly deny now confess cry out against alexander a if he be the cause of this then the governor summon him and inquire who he be and when he answer that he be a christian be very angry he condemn him to the wild beast and on the next day he enter along with attalus for to please the people the governor have order attalus again to the wild beast and they be torture in the amphitheater with all the instrument contrive for that purpose and have endure a very great conflict be at last sacrifice alexander neither groan nor murmur in any manner but commune in his heart with god but when attalus be place in the iron seat and the fume arose from his burning body he say to the people in the roman language lo this which ye do be devour men but we do not devour men nor do any other wicked thing and be ask what name god have he reply god have not a name a man have after all these on the last day of the contest blandina be again brought in with ponticus a boy about fifteen year old they have be brought every day to witness the suffering of the others and have be press to swear by the idol but because they remain steadfast and despise them the multitude become furious so that they have no compassion for the youth of the boy nor respect for the sex of the woman therefore they expose them to all the terrible suffering and take them through the entire round of torture repeatedly urge them to swear but be unable to effect this for ponticus encourage by his sister so that even the heathen could see that she be confirm and strengthen him have nobly endure every torture give up the ghost but the bless blandina last of all have a a noble mother encourage her child and sent them before her victorious to the king endure herself all their conflict and hasten after them glad and rejoice in her departure a if call to a marriage supper rather than east to wild beast and after the scourge after the wild beast after the roast seat she be finally enclose in a net and thrown before a bull and have be toss about by the animal but feel none of the thing which be happen to her on account of her hope and firm hold upon what have be entrust to her and her communion with christ she also be sacrifice and the heathen themselves confess that never among them have a woman endure so many and such terrible torture but not even thus be their madness and cruelty toward the saint satisfied for incite by the wild beast wild and barbarous tribe be not easily appease and their violence found another peculiar opportunity in the dead body for through their lack of manly reason the fact that they have be conquer do not put them to shame but rather the more enkindle their wrath a that of a wild beast and arouse alike the hatred of governor and people to treat u unjustly that the scripture might be fulfil he that be lawless let him be lawless still and he that be righteous let him be righteous still for they cast to the dog those who have die of suffocation in the prison carefully guard them by night and day l any one should be bury by u and they expose the remains left by the wild beast and by fire mangle and char and place the head of the others by their body and guard them in like manner from burial by a watch of soldier for many day and some rag and gnash their teeth against them desire to execute more severe vengeance upon them but others laugh and mocked at them magnify their own idol and impute to them the punishment of the christian even the more reasonable and those who have seem to sympathize somewhat reproach them often say where be their god and what have their religion which they have chosen rather than life profit them so various be their conduct toward u but we be in deep affliction because we could not bury the body for neither do night avail u for this purpose nor do money persuade nor entreaty move to compassion but they kept watch in every way a if the prevention of the burial would be of some great advantage to them in addition they say after other thing the body of the martyr have thus in every manner be exhibit and expose for six day be afterward burn and reduce to ash and swept into the rhone by the wicked men so that no trace of them might appear on the earth and this they do a if able to conquer god and prevent their new birth that a they say they may have no hope of a resurrection through trust in which they bring to u this foreign and new religion and despise terrible thing and be ready even to go to death with joy now let u see if they will rise again and if their god be able to help them and to deliver them out of our hand chapter the martyr beloved of god kindly minister unto those who fell in the persecution such thing happen to the church of christ under the abovementioned emperor from which we may reasonably conjecture the occurrence in the other province it be proper to add other selection from the same letter in which the moderation and compassion of these witness be record in the follow word they be also so zealous in their imitation of christ who be in the form of god count it not a prize to be on an equality with god that though they have attain such honor and have born witness not once or twice but many time have be brought back to prison from the wild beast cover with burn and scar and wound yet they do not proclaim themselves witness nor do they suffer u to address them by this name if any one of u in letter or conversation spoke of them a witness they rebuke him sharply for they concede cheerfully the appellation of witness to christ the faithful and true witness and firstborn of the dead and prince of the life of god and they remind u of the witness who have already depart and say they be already witness whom christ have deem worthy to be take up in their confession have seal their testimony by their departure but we be lowly and humble confessor and they besought the brother with tear that earnest prayer should be offer that they might be make perfect they show in their deed the power of testimony manifest great boldness toward all the brother and they make plain their nobility through patience and fearlessness and courage but they refuse the title of witness a distinguish them from their brother be fill with the fear of god a little far on they say they humble themselves under the mighty hand by which they be now greatly exalt they defend all but accuse none they absolve all but bound none and they prayed for those who have inflict cruelty upon them even a stephen the perfect witness lord lay not this sin to their charge but if he prayed for those who stone him how much more for the brother and again after mention other matter they say for through the genuineness of their love their great contest with him be that the beast be choked might cast out alive those whom he suppose he have swallow for they do not boast over the fall but help them in their need with those thing in which they themselves abound have the compassion of a mother and shed many tear on their account before the father they ask for life and he give it to them and they share it with their neighbor victorious over everything they depart to god have always love peace and have commend peace to u they go in peace to god leave no sorrow to their mother nor division or strife to the brother but joy and peace and concord and love this record of the affection of those bless one toward the brother that have fall may be profitably add on account of the inhuman and unmerciful disposition of those who after these event act unsparingly toward the member of christ chapter the vision which appear in a dream to the witness attalus the same letter of the abovementioned witness contains another account worthy of remembrance no one will object to our bring it to the knowledge of our reader it run a follow for a certain alcibiades who be one of them lead a very austere life partake of nothing whatever but bread and water when he endeavor to continue this same sort of life in prison it be reveal to attalus after his first conflict in the amphitheater that alcibiades be not do well in refuse the creature of god and place a stumblingblock before others and alcibiades obeyed and partook of all thing without restraint give thanks to god for they be not deprive of the grace of god but the holy ghost be their counselor let this suffice for these matter the follower of montanus alcibiades and theodotus in phrygia be now first give wide circulation to their assumption in regard to prophecy for the may other miracle that through the gift of god be still wrought in the different church cause their prophesy to be readily credit by many and a dissension arose concern them the brother in gaul set forth their own prudent and most orthodox judgment in the matter and publish also several epistle from the witness that have be put to death among them these they sent while they be still in prison to the brother throughout asia and phrygia and also to eleutherus who be then bishop of rome negotiate for the peace of the church chapter irenaeus commend by the witness in a letter the same witness also recommend irenaeus who be already at that time a presbyter of the parish of lyon to the abovementioned bishop of rome say many favorable thing in regard to him a the follow extract show we pray father eleutherus that you may rejoice in god in all thing and always we have request our brother and comrade irenaeus to carry this letter to you and we ask you to hold him in esteem a zealous for the covenant of christ for if we thought that office could confer righteousness upon any one we should commend him among the first a a presbyter of the church which be his position why should we transcribe the catalogue of the witness give in the letter already mention of whom some be behead others cast to the wild beast and others fell asleep in prison or give the number of confessor still survive at that time for whoever desire can readily find the full account by consult the letter itself which a i have say be record in our collection of martyrdom such be the event which happen under antoninus chapter god sent rain from heaven for marcus aurelius caesar in answer to the prayer of our people it be report that marcus aurelius caesar brother of antoninus be about to engage in battle with the german and sarmatians be in great trouble on account of his army suffer from thirst but the soldier of the socalled melitene legion through the faith which have give strength from that time to the present when they be drawn up before the enemy kneel on the ground a be our custom in prayer and engage in supplication to god this be indeed a strange sight to the enemy but it be report that a stranger thing immediately follow the lightning drove the enemy to flight and destruction but a shower refresh the army of those who have call on god all of whom have be on the point of perish with thirst this story be related by nonchristian writer who have be pleased to treat the time refer to and it have also be record by our own people by those historian who be stranger to the faith the marvel be mention but it be not acknowledge a an answer to our prayer but by our own people a friend of the truth the occurrence be related in a simple and artless manner among these be apolinarius who say that from that time the legion through whose prayer the wonder take place receive from the emperor a title appropriate to the event be call in the language of the roman the thunder legion tertullian be a trustworthy witness of these thing in the apology for the faith which he address to the roman senate and which work we have already mention he confirms the history with great and strong proof he writes that there be still extant letter of the most intelligent emperor marcus in which he testifies that his army be on the point of perish with thirst in germany be save by the prayer of the christian and he say also that this emperor threaten death to those who brought accusation against u he add far what kind of law be those which impious unjust and cruel person use against u alone which vespasian though he have conquer the jew do not regard which trajan partially annul forbid christian to be sought after which neither adrian though inquisitive in all matter nor he who be call plus sanction but let any one treat these thing a he chooses we must pas on to what follow pothinus have die with the other martyr in gaul at ninety year of age irenaeus succeed him in the episcopate of the church at lyon we have learn that in his youth he be a hearer of polycarp in the third book of his work against heresy he have insert a list of the bishop of rome bring it down a far a eleutherus whose time we be now consider under whom he compose his work he writes a follow chapter catalogue of the bishop of rome the bless apostle have found and establish the church entrust the office of the episcopate to linus paul speaks of this linus in his epistle to timothy anencletus succeed him and after anencletus in the third place from the apostle clement receive the episcopate he have see and converse with the bless apostle and their preach be still sound in his ear and their tradition be still before his eye nor be he alone in this for many who have be taught by the apostle yet survive in the time of clement a serious dissension have arisen among the brother in corinth the church of rome sent a most suitable letter to the corinthian reconcile them in peace renew their faith and proclaim the doctrine lately receive from the apostle a little farther on he say evarestus succeed clement and alexander evarestus then xystus the sixth from the apostle be appoint after him telesphorus who suffer martyrdom gloriously then hyginus then pius and after him anicetus sorer succeed anicetus and now in the twelfth place from the apostle eleutherus hold the office of bishop in the same order and succession the tradition in the church and the preach of the truth have descend from the apostle unto u chapter even down to those time miracle be perform by the faithful these thing irenaeus in agreement with the account already give by u record in the work which comprises five book and to which he give the title refutation and overthrow of the knowledge falsely socalled in the second book of the same treatise he show that manifestation of divine and miraculous power continued to his time in some of the church he say but so far do they come short of raise the dead a the lord raise them and the apostle through prayer and oftentimes in the brotherhood when on account of some necessity our entire church have besought with fast and much supplication the spirit of the dead have return and the man have be restore through the prayer of the saint and again after other remark he say if they will say that even the lord do these thing in mere appearance we will refer them to the prophetic writing and show from them that all thing be beforehand spoken of him in this manner and be strictly fulfil and that he alone be the son of god wherefore his true disciple receive grace from him perform such work in his name for the benefit of other men a each have receive the gift from him for some of them drive out demon effectually and truly so that those who have be cleanse from evil spirit frequently believe and unite with the church others have a foreknowledge of future event and vision and prophetic revelation still others heal the sick by the lay on of hand and restore them to health and a we have say even dead person have be raise and remain with u many year but why should we say more it be not possible to recount the number of gift which the church throughout all the world have receive from god in the name of jesus christ who be crucify under pontius pilate and exercise every day for the benefit of the heathen never deceive any nor do it for money for a she have receive freely from god freely also do she minister and in another place the same author writes a also we hear that many brother in the church posse prophetic gift and speak through the spirit with all kind of tongue and bring to light the secret thing of men for their good and declare the mystery of god so much in regard to the fact that various gift remain among those who be worthy even until that time chapter the statement of irenaeus in regard to the divine scripture since in the begin of this work we promise to give when needful the word of the ancient presbyter and writer of the church in which they have declare those tradition which come down to them concern the canonical book and since irenaeus be one of them we will now give his word and first what he say of the sacred gospel matthew publish his gospel among the hebrew in their own language while peter and paul be preach and found the church in rome after their departure mark the disciple and interpreter of peter also transmit to u in write those thing which peter have preach and luke the attendant of paul record in a book the gospel which paul have declare afterwards john the disciple of the lord who also recline on his bosom publish his gospel while stay at ephesus in asia he state these thing in the third book of his abovementioned work in the fifth book he speaks a follow concern the apocalypse of john and the number of the name of antichrist a these thing be so and this number be found in all the approve and ancient copy and those who saw john face to face confirm it and reason teach u that the number of the name of the beast accord to the mode of calculation among the greek appear in it letter and farther on he say concern the same we be not bold enough to speak confidently of the name of antichrist for if it be necessary that his name should be declare clearly at the present time it would have be announce by him who saw the revelation for it be see not long ago but almost in our generation toward the end of the reign of domitian he state these thing concern the apocalypse in the work refer to he also mention the first epistle of john take many proof from it and likewise the first epistle of peter and he not only know but also receives the shepherd write a follow well do the scripture speak say first of all believe that god be one who have create and complete all thing etc and he us almost the precise word of the wisdom of solomon say the vision of god produce immortality but immortality render u near to god he mention also the memoir of a certain apostolic presbyter whose name he pass by in silence and give his exposition of the sacred scripture and he refers to justin the martyr and to ignatius use testimony also from their writing moreover he promise to refute marcion from his own writing in a special work concern the translation of the inspire scripture by the seventy hear the very word which he writes god in truth become man and the lord himself save u give the sign of the virgin but not a some say who now venture to translate the scripture behold a young woman shall conceive and bring forth a son a theodotion of ephesus and aquila of pontus both of them jewish proselyte interpret follow whom the ebionite say that he be begotten by joseph shortly after he add for before the roman have establish their empire while the macedonian be still hold asia ptolemy the son of lagus be desirous of adorn the library which he have round in alexandria with the meritorious writing of all men request the people of jerusalem to have their scripture translate into the greek language but a they be then subject to the macedonian they sent to ptolemy seventy elder who be the most skilled among them in the scripture and in both language thus god accomplish his purpose but wish to try them individually a he fear l by take counsel together they might conceal the truth of the scripture by their interpretation he separate them from one another and command all of them to write the same translation he do this for all the book but when they come together in the presence of ptolemy and compare their several translation god be glorify and the scripture be recognize a truly divine for all of them have render the same thing in the same word and with the same name from begin to end so that the heathen perceive that the scripture have be translate by the inspiration of god and this be nothing wonderful for god to do who in the captivity of the people trader nebuchadnezzar when the scripture have be destroyed and the jew have return to their own country after seventy year afterwards in the time of artaxerxes king of the persian inspire ezra the priest of the tribe of levi to relate all the word of the former prophet and to restore to the people the legislation of moses such be the word of irenaeus chapter the bishop under commodus after antoninus have be emperor for nineteen year commodus receive the government in his first year julian become bishop of the alexandrian church after agrippinus have held the office for twelve year chapter pantaenus the philosopher about that time pantaenus a man highly distinguish for his learn have charge of the school of the faithful in alexandria a school of sacred learn which continue to our day be establish there in ancient time and a we have be inform be manage by men of great ability and zeal for divine thing among these it be report that pantaenus be at that time especially conspicuous a he have be educate in the philosophical system of those call stoic they say that he displayed such zeal for the divine word that he be appoint a a herald of the gospel of christ to the nation in the east and be sent a far a india for indeed there be still many evangelist of the word who sought earnestly to use their inspire zeal after the example of the apostle for the increase and building up of the divine word pantaenus be one of these and be say to have go to india it be report that among person there who knew of christ he found the gospel accord to matthew which have anticipate his own arrival for bartholomew one of the apostle have preach to them and left with them the write of matthew in the hebrew language which they have preserve till that time after many good deed pantaenus finally become the head of the school at alexandria and expound the treasure of divine doctrine both orally and in write chapter clement of alexandria at this time clement be train with him in the divine scripture at alexandria become well know he have the same name a the one who anciently be at the head of the roman church and who be a disciple of the apostle in his hypotyposes he speaks of pantaenus by name a his teacher it seem to me that he alludes to the same person also in the first book of his stroma when refer to the more conspicuous of the successor of the apostle whom he have met he say this work be not a write artfully construct for display but my note be store up for old age a a remedy against forgetfulness an image without art and a rough sketch of those powerful and animate word which it be my privilege to hear a well a of bless and truly remarkable men of these the one the ionian __ be in greece the other in magna graecia the one of them be from coelesyria the other from egypt there be others in the east one of them an assyrian the other a hebrew in palestine but when i met with the last in ability truly he be first have hunt him out in his concealment in egypt i found rest these men preserve the true tradition of the bless doctrine directly from the holy apostle peter and james and john and paul the son receive it from the father but few be like the father have come by god will even to u to deposit those ancestral and apostolic seed chapter the bishop in jerusalem at this time narcissus be the bishop of the church at jerusalem and he be celebrate by many to this day he be the fifteenth in succession from the siege of the jew under adrian we have show that from that time first the church in jerusalem be compose of gentile after those of the circumcision and that marcus be the first gentile bishop that preside over them after him the succession in the episcopate be first cassianus after him publius then maximus follow them julian then gaius after him symmachus and another gaius and again another julian after these capito and valens and dolichianus and after all of them narcissus the thirtieth in regular succession from the apostle chapter rhodo and his account of the dissension of marcion at this time rhodo a native of asia who have be instruct a he himself state by tatian with whom we have already become acquaint have write several book publish among the rest one against the heresy of marcion he say that this heresy be divide in his time into various opinion and while describe those who occasion the division he refutes accurately the falsehood devise by each of them but hear what he writes therefore also they disagree among themselves maintain an inconsistent opinion for apelles one of the herd pride himself on his manner of life and his age acknowledges one principle but say that the prophecy be from an oppose spirit be lead to this view by the response of a maiden by name philumene who be possess by a demon but others among whom be potitus and basilicus hold to two principle a do the mariner marcion himself these follow the wolf of pontus and like him unable to fathom the division of thing become reckless and without give any proof assert two principle others again drift into a bad error consider that there be not only two but three nature of these syneros be the leader and chief a those who defend his teach say the same author writes that he engage in conversation with apelles he speaks a follow for the old man apelles when converse with u be refute in many thing which he spoke falsely whence also he say that it be not at all necessary to examine one doctrine but that each one should continue to hold what he believe for he assert that those who trust in the crucify would be save if only they be found do good work but a we have say before his opinion concern god be the most obscure of all for he spoke of one principle a also our doctrine do then after state fully his own opinion he add when i say to him tell me how you know this or how can you assert that there be one principle he reply that the prophecy refute themselves because they have say nothing true for they be inconsistent and false and selfcontradictory but how there be one principle he say that he do not know but that he be thus persuade a i then adjure him to speak the truth he swore that he do so when he say that he do not know how there be one unbegotten god but that he believe it thereupon i laugh and reprove him because though call himself a teacher he knew not how to confirm what he taught in the same work address callistio the same writer acknowledges that he have be instruct at rome by tatian and he say that a book of problem have be prepared by tatian in which he promise to explain the obscure and hidden part of the divine scripture rhodo himself promise to give in a work of his own solution of tatians problem there be also extant a commentary of his on the hexaemeron but this apelles write many thing an impious manner of the law of moses blaspheming the divine word in many of his work be a it seem very zealous for their refutation and overthrow so much concern these chapter the false prophet of the phrygian the enemy of god church who be emphatically a hater of good and a lover of evil and leaf untried no manner of craft against men be again active in cause strange heresy to spring up against the church for some person like venomous reptile crawl over asia and phrygia boasting that montanus be the paraclete and that the woman that follow him priscilla and maximilla be prophetess of montanus chapter the schism of blastus at rome others of whom florinus be chief flourish at rome he fell from the presbyterate of the church and blastus be involve in a similar fall they also drew away many oft the church to their opinion each strive to introduce his own innovation in respect to the truth chapter the circumstance related of montanus and his false prophet against the socalled phrygian heresy the power which always contends for the truth raise up a strong and invincible weapon apolinarius of hierapolis whom we have mention before and with him many other men of ability by whom abundant material for our history have be left a certain one of these in the begin of his work against them first intimate that he have contend with them in oral controversy he commences his work in this manner have for a very long and sufficient time o beloved avircius marcellus be urge by you to write a treatise against the heresy of those who be call after miltiades i have hesitate till the present time not through lack of ability to refute the falsehood or bear testimony for the truth but from fear and apprehension that i might seem to some to be make addition to the doctrine or precept of the gospel of the new testament which it be impossible for one who have chosen to live accord to the gospel either to increase or to diminish but be recently in ancyra in galatia i found the church there greatly agitate by this novelty not prophecy a they call it but rather false prophecy a will be show therefore to the best of our ability with the lord help we dispute in the church many day concern these and other matter separately brought forward by them so that the church rejoice and be strengthen in the truth and those of the opposite side be for the time confound and the adversary be grieve the presbyter in the place our fellowpresbyter zoticus of otrous also be present request u to leave a record of what have be say against the opposer of the truth we do not do this but we promise to write it out a soon a the lord permit u and to send it to them speedily have say this with other thing in the begin of his work he proceeds to state the cause of the abovementioned heresy a follow their opposition and their recent heresy which have separate them from the church arose on the follow account there be say to be a certain village call ardabau in that part of mysia which border upon phrygia there first they say when gratus be proconsul of asia a recent convert montanus by name through his unquenchable desire for leadership give the adversary opportunity against him and he become beside himself and be suddenly in a sort of frenzy and ecstasy he rave and begin to babble and utter strange thing prophesy in a manner contrary to the constant custom of the church hand down by tradition from the begin some of those who heard his spurious utterance at that time be indignant and they rebuke him a one that be possess and that be under the control of a demon and be lead by a deceitful spirit and be distract the multitude and they forbade him to talk remember the distinction drawn by the lord and his warn to guard watchfully against the come of false prophet but others imagine themselves possess of the holy spirit and of a prophetic gift be elate and not a little puffed up and forget the distinction of the lord they challenged the mad and insidious and seduce spirit and be cheat and deceive by him in consequence of this he could no longer be held in check so a to keep silence thus by artifice or rather by such a system of wicked craft the devil devise destruction for the disobedient and be unworthily honor by them secretly excite and inflame their understanding which have already become estrange from the true faith and he stir up besides two woman and fill them with the false spirit so that they talk wildly and unreasonably and strangely like the person already mention and the spirit pronounce them bless a they rejoice and glory in him and puffed them up by the magnitude of his promise but sometimes he rebuke them openly in a wise and faithful manner that he might seem to be a reprover but those of the phrygian that be deceive be few in number and the arrogant spirit taught them to revile the entire universal church under heaven because the spirit of false prophecy receive neither honor from it nor entrance into it for the faithful in asia met often in many place throughout asia to consider this matter and examine the novel utterance and pronounce them profane and reject the heresy and thus these person be expel from the church and debar from communion have related these thing at the outset and continued the refutation of their delusion through his entire work in the second book he speaks a follow of their end since therefore they call u slayer of the prophet because we do not receive their loquacious prophet who they say be those that the lord promise to send to the people let them answer a in god presence who be there o friend of these who begin to talk from montanus and the woman down that be persecute by the jew or slain by lawless men none or have any of them be seize and crucify for the name truly not or have one of these woman ever be scourge in the synagogue of the jew or stone no never anywhere but by another kind of death montanus and maximilla be say to have die for the report be that incite by the spirit of frenzy they both hung themselves not at the same time but at the time which common report give for the death of each and thus they die and end their life like the traitor juda so also a general report say that remarkable person the first steward a it be of their socalled prophecy one theodotus who a if at sometime take up and receive into heaven fell into trance and entrust himself to the deceitful spirit be pitch like a quoit and die miserably they say that these thing happen in this manner but a we do not see them o friend we do not pretend to know perhaps in such a manner perhaps not montanus and theodotus and the abovementioned woman die he say again in the same book that the holy bishop of that time attempt to refute the spirit in maximilla but be prevent by others who plainly cooperate with the spirit he writes a follow and let not the spirit in the same work of asterius urbanus say through maximilla i be driven away from the sheep like a wolf i be not a wolf i be word and spirit and power but let him show clearly and prove the power in the spirit and by the spirit let him compel those to confess him who be then present for the purpose of prove and reason with the talkative spirit those eminent men and bishop zoticus from the village comana and julian from apamea whose mouth the follower of themiso muzzle refuse to permit the false and seductive spirit to be refute by them again in the same work after say other thing in refutation of the false prophecy of maximilla he indicates the time when he write these account and mention her prediction in which she prophesy war and anarchy their falsehood he censure in the follow manner and have not this be show clearly to be false for it be today more than thirteen year since the woman die and there have be neither a partial nor general war in the world but rather through the mercy of god continued peace even to the christian these thing be take from the second book i will add also short extract from the third book in which he speaks thus against their boast that many of them have suffer martyrdom when therefore they be at a loss be refute in all that they say they try to take refuge in their martyr allege that they have many martyr and that this be sure evidence of the power of the socalled prophetic spirit that be with them but this a it appear be entirely fallacious for some of the heresy have a great many martyr but surely we shall not on that account agree with them or confess that they hold the truth and first indeed those call marcionites from the heresy of marcion say that they have a multitude of martyr for christ yet they do not confess christ himself in truth a little farther on he continue when those call to martyrdom from the church for the truth of the faith have met with any of the socalled martyr of the phrygian heresy they have separate from them and die without any fellowship with them because they do not wish to give their assent to the spirit of montanus and the woman and that this be true and take place in our own time in apamea on the maeander among those who suffer martyrdom with gaius and alexander of eumenia be well know chapter miltiades and his work in this work he mention a writer miltiades state that he also write a certain book against the abovementioned heresy after quote some of their word he add have found these thing in a certain work of theirs in opposition to the work of the brother alcibiades in which he show that a prophet ought not to speak in ecstasy i make an abridgment a little far on in the same work he give a list of those who prophesy under the new covenant among whom he enumerates a certain ammia and quadratus say but the false prophet fall into an ecstasy in which he be without shame or fear begin with purpose ignorance he pass on a have be state involuntary madness of soul they can not show that one of the old or one of the new prophet be thus carry away in spirit neither can they boast of agabus or juda or silas or the daughter of philip or ammia in philadelphia or quadratus or any others not belonging to them and again after a little he say for if after quadratus and ammia in philadelphia a they assert the woman with montanus receive the prophetic gift let them show who among them receive it from montanus and the woman for the apostle thought it necessary that the prophetic gift should continue in all the church until the final come but they can not show it though this be the fourteenth year since the death of maximilla he writes thus but the miltiades to whom he refers have left other monument of his own zeal for the divine scripture in the discourse which he compose against the greek and against the jew answer each of them separately in two book and in addition he address an apology to the earthly ruler in behalf of the philosophy which he embrace chapter the manner in which apollonius refute the phrygian and the person whom he mention a the socalled phrygian heresy be still flourish in phrygia in his time apollonius also an ecclesiastical writer undertook it refutation and write a special work against it correct in detail the false prophecy current among them and reprove the life of the founder of the heresy but hear his own word respect montanus his action and his teach show who this new teacher be this be he who taught the dissolution of marriage who make law for fast who name pepuza and tymion small town in phrygia jerusalem wish to gather people to them from all direction who appoint collector of money who contrive the receive of gift under the name of offering who provide salary for those who preach his doctrine that it teach might prevail through gluttony he writes thus concern montanus and a little farther on he writes a follow concern his prophetess we show that these first prophetess themselves a soon a they be fill with the spirit abandon their husband how falsely therefore they speak who call prisca a virgin afterwards he say do not all scripture seem to you to forbid a prophet to receive gift and money when therefore i see the prophetess receive gold and silver and costly garment how can i avoid reprove her and again a little farther on he speaks thus concern one of their confessor so also themiso who be clothed with plausible covetousness could not endure the sign of confession but threw aside bond for an abundance of possession yet though he should have be humble on this account he dare to boast a a martyr and in imitation of the apostle he write a certain catholic epistle to instruct those whose faith be well than his own contend for word of empty sound and blaspheming against the lord and the apostle and the holy church and again concern others of those honor among them a martyr he writes a follow not to speak of many let the prophetess herself tell u of alexander who call himself a martyr with whom she be in the habit of banqueting and who be worship by many we need not mention his robbery and other dare deed for which he be punish but the archive contain them which of these forgives the sin of the other do the prophet the robbery of the martyr or the martyr the covetousness of the prophet for although the lord say provide neither gold nor silver neither two coat these men in complete opposition transgress in respect to the possession of the forbidden thing for we will show that those whom they call prophet and martyr gather their gain not only from rich men but also from the poor and orphan and widow but if they be confident let them stand up and discus these matter that if convict they may hereafter cease transgress for the fruit of the prophet must be try for the tree be know by it fruit but that those who wish may know concern alexander he be try by aemilius frontinus proconsul at ephesus not on account of the name but for the robbery which he have commit be already an apostate afterwards have falsely declare for the name of the lord he be release have deceive the faithful that be there and his own parish from which he come do not receive him because he be a robber those who wish to learn about him have the public record of asia and yet the prophet with whom he spent many year know nothing about him expose him through him we expose also the pretense of the prophet we could show the same thing of many others but if they be confident let them endure the test again in another part of his work he speaks a follow of the prophet of whom they boast if they deny that their prophet have receive gift let them acknowledge this that if they be convict of receive them they be not prophet and we will bring a multitude of proof of this but it be necessary that all the fruit of a prophet should be examine tell me do a prophet dye his hair do a prophet stain his eyelid do a prophet delight in adornment do a prophet play with table and dice do a prophet lend on usury let them confess whether these thing be lawful or not but i will show that they have be do by them this same apollonius state in the same work that at the time of his write it be the fortieth year since montanus have begin his pretend prophecy and he say also that zoticus who be mention by the former writer when maximilla be pretend to prophesy in pepuza resist her and endeavor to refute the spirit that be work in her but be prevent by those who agree with her he mention also a certain thraseas among the martyr of that time he speaks moreover of a tradition that the savior command his apostle not to depart from jerusalem for twelve year he us testimony also from the revelation of john and he relates that a dead man have through the divine power be raise by john himself in ephesus he also add other thing by which he fully and abundantly expose the error of the heresy of which we have be speak these be the matter record by apollonius chapter serapion on the heresy of the phrygian serapion who a report say succeed maximinus at that time a bishop of the church of antioch mention the work of apolinarius against the abovementioned heresy and he alludes to him in a private letter to caricus and pontius in which he himself expose the same heresy and add the follow word that you may see that the doings of this lie band of the new prophecy so call be an abomination to all the brotherhood throughout the world i have sent you writing of the most bless claudius apolinarius bishop of hierapolis in asia in the same letter of serapion the signature of several bishop be found one of whom subscribes himself a follow i aurelius cyrenius a witness pray for your health and another in this manner aelius publius julius bishop of debeltum a colony of thrace a god liveth in the heaven the bless sotas in anchialus desire to cast the demon out of priscilla but the hypocrite do not permit him and the autograph signature of many other bishop who agree with them be contain in the same letter so much for these person chapter the writing of irenaeus against the schismatics at rome irenaeus write several letter against those who be disturb the sound ordinance of the church at rome one of them be to blastus on schism another to florinus on monarchy or that god be not the author of evil for florinus seem to be defend this opinion and because he be be drawn away by the error of valentinus irenaeus write his work on the ogdoad in which he show that he himself have be acquaint with the first successor of the apostle at the close of the treatise we have found a most beautiful note which we be constrain to insert in this work it run a follow i adjure thee who mayest copy this book by our lord jesus christ and by his glorious advent when he come to judge the living and the dead to compare what thou shalt write and correct it carefully by this manuscript and also to write this adjuration and place it in the copy these thing may be profitably read in his work and related by u that we may have those ancient and truly holy men a the best example of painstaking carefulness in the letter to florinus of which we have spoken irenaeus mention again his intimacy with polycarp say these doctrine o florinus to speak mildly be not of sound judgment these doctrine disagree with the church and drive into the great impiety those who accept them these doctrine not even the heretic outside of the church have ever dare to publish these doctrine the presbyter who be before u and who be companion of the apostle do not deliver to thee for when i be a boy i saw thee in low asia with polycarp move in splendor in the royal court and endeavor to gain his approbation i remember the event of that time more clearly than those of recent year for what boy learn grow with their mind becomes join with it so that i be able to describe the very place in which the bless polycarp sat a he discourse and his going out and his coming in and the manner of his life and his physical appearance and his discourse to the people and the account which he give of his intercourse with john and with the others who have see the lord and a he remember their word and what he heard from them concern the lord and concern his miracle and his teach have receive them from eyewitness of the word of life polycarp related all thing in harmony with the scripture these thing be told me by the mercy of god i listen to them attentively note them down not on paper but in my heart and continually through god grace i recall them faithfully and i be able to bear witness before god that if that bless and apostolic presbyter have heard any such thing he would have cry out and stop his ear and a be his custom would have exclaim o good god unto what time hast thou spar me that i should endure these thing and he would have flee from the place where sit or stand he have heard such word and this can be show plainly from the letter which he sent either to the neighbor church for their confirmation or to some of the brother admonish and exhort them thus far irenaeus chapter how appolonius suffer martyrdom at rome about the same time in the reign of commodus our condition become more favorable and through the grace of god the church throughout the entire world enjoy peace and the word of salvation be lead every soul from every race of man to the devout worship of the god of the universe so that now at rome many who be highly distinguish for wealth and family turn with all their household and relative unto their salvation but the demon who hate what be good be malignant in his nature could not endure this but prepared himself again for conflict contrive many device against u and he brought to the judgment seat apollonius of the city of rome a man renowned among the faithful for learn and philosophy have stir up one of his servant who be well fit for such a purpose to accuse him but this wretched man make the charge unseasonably because by a royal decree it be unlawful that informer of such thing should live and his leg be broken immediately perennius the judge have pronounce this sentence upon him but the martyr highly beloved of god be earnestly entreat and request by the judge to give an account of himself before the senate make in the presence of all an eloquent defense of the faith for which he be witness and a if by decree of the senate he be put to death by decapitation an ancient law require that those who be brought to the judgment seat and refuse to recant should not be liberate whoever desire to know his argument before the judge and his answer to the question of perennius and his entire defense before the senate will find them in the record of the ancient martyrdom which we have collect chapter the bishop that be well know at this time in the tenth year of the reign of commodus victor succeed eleutherus the latter have held the episcopate for thirteen year in the same year after julian a have complete his tenth year demetrius receive the charge of the parish at alexandria at this time the abovementioned serapion the eighth from the apostle be still well know a bishop of the church at antioch theophilus preside at caesarea in palestine and narcissus whom we have mention before still have charge of the church at jerusalem bacchylus at the same time be bishop of corinth in greece and polycrates of the parish of ephesus and besides these a multitude of others a be likely be then prominent but we have give the name of those alone the soundness of whose faith have come down to u in write chapter the question then agitate concern the passover a question of no small importance aroseat that time for the parish of all asia a from an old tradition held that the fourteenth day of the moon on which day the jew be command to sacrifice the lamb should be observe a the feast of the savior passover it be therefore necessary to end their fast on that day whatever day of the week it should happen to be but it be not the custom of the church in the rest of the world to end it at this time a they observe the practice which from apostolic tradition have prevail to the present time of terminate the fast on no other day than on that of the resurrection of our savior synod and assembly of bishop be held on this account and all with one consent through mutual correspondence drew up an ecclesiastical decree that the mystery of the resurrection of the lord should be celebrate on no other but the lord day and that we should observe the close of the paschal fast on this day only there be still extant a write of those who be then assemble in palestine over whom theophilus bishop of caesarea and narcissus bishop of jerusalem preside and there be also another write extant of those who be assemble at rome to consider the same question which bear the name of bishop victor also of the bishop in pontus over whom palmas a the old preside and of the parish in gaul of which irenaeus be bishop and of those in osrhoene and the city there and a personal letter of bacchylus bishop of the church at corinth and of a great many others who uttered the same opinion and judgment and cast the same vote and that which have be give above be their unanimous decision chapter the disagreement in asia but the bishop of asia lead by polycrates decide to hold to the old custom hand down to them he himself in a letter which he address to victor and the church of rome set forth in the follow word the tradition which have come down to him we observe the exact day neither add nor take away for in asia also great light have fall asleep which shall rise again on the day of the lord come when he shall come with glory from heaven and shall seek out all the saint among these be philip one of the twelve apostle who fell asleep in hierapolis and his two age virgin daughter and another daughter who live in the holy spirit and now rest at ephesus and moreover john who be both a witness and a teacher who recline upon the bosom of the lord and be a priest wore the sacerdotal plate he fell asleep at ephesus and polycarp in smyrna who be a bishop and martyr and thraseas bishop and martyr from eumenia who fell asleep in smyrna why need i mention the bishop and martyr sagaris who fell asleep in laodicea or the bless papirius or melito the eunuch who live altogether in the holy spirit and who lie in sardis await the episcopate from heaven when he shall rise from the dead all these observe the fourteenth day of the passover accord to the gospel deviate in no respect but follow the rule of faith and i also polycrates the least of you all do accord to the tradition of my relative some of whom i have closely follow for seven of my relative be bishop and i be the eighth and my relative always observe the day when the people put away the leaven i therefore brother who have live sixtyfive year in the lord and have met with the brother throughout the world and have go through every holy scripture be not affright by terrify word for those great than i have say we ought to obey god rather than man he then writes of all the bishop who be present with him and thought a he do his word be a follow i could mention the bishop who be present whom i summon at your desire whose name should i write them would constitute a great multitude and they beholding my littleness give their consent to the letter know that i do not bear my gray hair in vain but have always govern my life by the lord jesus thereupon victor who preside over the church at rome immediately attempt to cut off from the common unity the parish of all asia with the church that agree with them a heterodox and he write letter and declare all the brother there wholly excommunicate but this do not please all the bishop and they besought him to consider the thing of peace and of neighborly unity and love word of theirs be extant sharply rebuke victor among them be irenaeus who send letter in the name of the brother in gaul over whom he preside maintain that the mystery of the resurrection of the lord should be observe only on the lord day he fittingly admonishes victor that he should not cut off whole church of god which observe the tradition of an ancient custom and after many other word he proceeds a follow for the controversy be not only concern the day but also concern the very manner of the fast for some think that they should fast one day others two yet others more some moreover count their day a consist of forty hour day and night and this variety in it observance have not originate in our time but long before in that of our ancestor it be likely that they do not hold to strict accuracy and thus form a custom for their posterity accord to their own simplicity and peculiar mode yet all of these live none the less in peace and we also live in peace with one another and the disagreement in regard to the fast confirms the agreement in the faith he add to this the follow account which i may properly insert among these be the presbyter before soter who preside over the church which thou now rulest we mean anicetus and plus and hyginus and telesphorus and xystus they neither observe it themselves nor do they permit those after them to do so and yet though not observe it they be none the less at peace with those who come to them from the parish in which it be observe although this observance be more oppose to those who do not observe it but none be ever cast out on account of this form but the presbyter before thee who do not observe it sent the eucharist to those of other parish who observe it and when the bless polycarp be at rome in the time of anicetus and they disagreed a little about certain other thing they immediately make peace with one another not care to quarrel over this matter for neither could anicetus persuade polycarp not to observe what he have always observe with john the disciple of our lord and the other apostle with whom he have associate neither could polycarp persuade anicetus to observe it a he say that he ought to follow the custom of the presbyter that have precede him but though matter be in this shape they commune together and anicetus concede the administration of the eucharist in the church to polycarp manifestly a a mark of respect and they part from each other in peace both those who observe and those who do not maintain the peace of the whole church thus irenaeus who truly be well name become a peacemaker in this matter exhort and negotiate in this way in behalf of the peace of the church and he confer by letter about this moot question not only with victor but also with most of the other ruler of the church chapter how all come to an agreement respect the passover those in palestine whom we have recently mention narcissus and theophilus and with them cassius bishop of the church of tyre and clarus of the church of ptolemais and those who met with them have state many thing respect the tradition concern the passover which have come to them in succession from the apostle at the close of their write add these word endeavor to send copy of our letter to every church that we may not furnish occasion to those who easily deceive their soul we show you indeed that also in alexandria they keep it on the same day that we do for letter be carry from u to them and from them to u so that in the same manner and at the same time we keep the sacred day chapter the elegant work of irenaeus which have come down to u besides the work and letter of irenaeus which we have mention a certain book of his on knowledge write against the greek very concise and remarkably forcible be extant and another which he dedicate to a brother martian in demonstration of the apostolic preach and a volume contain various dissertation in which he mention the epistle to the hebrew and the socalled wisdom of solomon make quotation from them these be the work of irenaeus which have come to our knowledge commodus have end his reign after thirteen year severus become emperor in less than six month after his death pertinax have reign during the intervene time chapter the work of others that flourish at that time numerous memorial of the faithful zeal of the ancient ecclesiastical men of that time be still preserve by many of these we would note particularly the writing of heraclitus on the apostle and those of maximus on the question so much discuss among heretic the origin of evil and on the creation of matter also those of candidus on the hexaemeron and of apion on the same subject likewise of sextus on the resurrection and another treatise of arabianus and writing of a multitude of others in regard to whom because we have no data it be impossible to state in our work when they live or to give any account of their history and work of many others have come down to u whose name we be unable to give orthodox and ecclesiastical a their interpretation of the divine scripture show but unknown to u because their name be not state in their writing chapter those who first advanced the heresy of artemon their manner of life and how they dare to corrupt the sacred scripture in a laborious work by one of these writer against the heresy of artemon which paul of samosata attempt to revive again in our day there be an account appropriate to the history which we be now examine for he criticizes a a late innovation the abovementioned heresy which teach that the savior be a mere man because they be attempt to magnify it a ancient have give in his work many other argument in refutation of their blasphemous falsehood he add the follow word for they say that all the early teacher and the apostle receive and taught what they now declare and that the truth of the gospel be preserve until the time of victor who be the thirteenth bishop of rome from peter but that from his successor zephyrinus the truth have be corrupt and what they say might be plausible if first of all the divine scripture do not contradict them and there be writing of certain brother old than the time of victor which they write in behalf of the truth against the heathen and against the heresy which exist in their day i refer to justin and miltiades and tatian and clement and many others in all of whose work christ be spoken of a god for who do not know the work of irenaeus and of melito and of others which teach that christ be god and man and how many psalm and hymn write by the faithful brother from the begin celebrate christ the word of god speak of him a divine how then since the opinion held by the church have be preach for so many year can it preach have be delayed a they affirm until the time of victor and how be it that they be not ashamed to speak thus falsely of victor know well that he cut off from communion theodotus the cobbler the leader and father of this goddenying apostasy and the first to declare that christ be mere man for if victor agree with their opinion a their slander affirms how come he to cast out theodotus the inventor of this heresy so much in regard to victor his bishopric last ten year and zephyrinus be appoint his successor about the ninth year of the reign of severus the author of the abovementioned book concern the founder of this heresy narrates another event which occur in the time of zephyrinus use these word i will remind many of the brother of a fact which take place in our time which have it happen in sodom might i think have prove a warn to them there be a certain confessor natalius not long ago but in our own day this man be deceive at one time by asclepiodotus and another theodotus a moneychanger both of them be disciple of theodotus the cobbler who a i have say be the first person excommunicate by victor bishop at that time on account of this sentiment or rather senselessness natalius be persuade by them to allow himself to be chosen bishop of this heresy with a salary to be paid by them of one hundred and fifty denarii a month when he have thus connect himself with them he be warn oftentimes by the lord through vision for the compassionate god and our lord jesus christ be not willing that a witness of his own suffering be cast out of the church should perish but a he paid little regard to the vision because he be ensnare by the first position among them and by that shameful covetousness which destroys a great many he be scourge by holy angel and punish severely through the entire night thereupon have risen in the morning he put on sackcloth and cover himself with ash and with great haste and tear he fell down before zephyrinus the bishop roll at the foot not only of the clergy but also of the laity and he move with his tear the compassionate church of the merciful christ and though he use much supplication and show the welt of the stripe which he have receive yet scarcely be he take back into communion we will add from the same writer some other extract concern them which run a follow they have treat the divine scripture recklessly and without fear they have set aside the rule of ancient faith and christ they have not know they do not endeavor to learn what the divine scripture declare but strive laboriously after any form of syllogism which may be devise to sustain their impiety and if any one brings before them a passage of divine scripture they see whether a conjunctive or disjunctive form of syllogism can be make from it and a be of the earth and speak of the earth and a ignorant of him who cometh from above they forsake the holy writing of god to devote themselves to geometry euclid be laboriously measure by some of them and aristotle and theophrastus be admire and galen perhaps by some be even worship but that those who use the art of unbeliever for their heretical opinion and adulterate the simple faith of the divine scripture by the craft of the godless be far from the faith what need be there to say therefore they have laid their hand boldly upon the divine scripture allege that they have correct them that i be not speak falsely of them in this matter whoever wish may learn for if any one will collect their respective copy and compare them one with another he will find that they differ greatly those of asclepiades for example do not agree with those of theodotus and many of these can be obtain because their disciple have assiduously write the correction a they call them that be the corruption of each of them again those of hermophilus do not agree with these and those of apollonides be not consistent with themselves for you can compare those prepared by them at an earlier date with those which they corrupt later and you will find them widely different but how dare this offense be it be not likely that they themselves be ignorant for either they do not believe that the divine scripture be spoken by the holy spirit and thus be unbeliever or else they think themselves wiser than the holy spirit and in that case what else be they than demoniac for they can not deny the commission of the crime since the copy have be write by their own hand for they do not receive such scripture from their instructor nor can they produce any copy from which they be transcribed but some of them have not thought it worth while to corrupt them but simply deny the law and the prophet and thus through their lawless and impious teach under pretense of grace have sunk to the low depth of perdition let this suffice for these thing book vi chapter the persecution under severus when severus begin to persecute the church glorious testimony be give everywhere by the athlete of religion this be especially the case in alexandria to which city a to a most prominent theater athlete of god be brought from egypt and all thebais accord to their merit and won crown from god through their great patience under many torture and every mode of death among these be leonides who be call the father of origen and who be behead while his son be still young how remarkable the predilection of this son be for the divine word in consequence of his father instruction it will not be amiss to state briefly a his fame have be very greatly celebrate by many chapter the training of origen from childhood many thing might be say in attempt to describe the life of the man while in school but this subject alone would require a separate treatise nevertheless for the present abridge most thing we shall state a few fact concern him a briefly a possible gathering them from certain letter and from the statement of person still living who be acquaint with him what they report of origen seem to me worthy of mention even so to speak from his swathingbands it be the tenth year of the reign of severus while laetus be governor of alexandria and the rest of egypt and demetrius have lately receive the episcopate of the parish there a successor of julian a the flame of persecution have be kindle greatly and multitude have gain the crown of martyrdom such desire for martyrdom seize the soul of origen although yet a boy that he go close to danger spring forward and rush to the conflict in his eagerness and truly the termination of his life have be very near have not the divine and heavenly providence for the benefit of many prevent his desire through the agency of his mother for at first entreat him she beg him to have compassion on her motherly feeling toward him but find that when he have learn that his father have be seize and imprison he be set the more resolutely and completely carry away with his zeal for martyrdom she hid all his clothing and thus compel him to remain at home but a there be nothing else that he could do and his zeal beyond his age would not suffer him to be quiet he sent to his father an encourage letter on martyrdom in which he exhort him say take heed not to change your mind on our account this may be record a the first evidence of origen youthful wisdom and of his genuine love for piety for even then he have store up no small resource in the word of the faith have be train in the divine scripture from childhood and he have not study them with indifference for his father besides give him the usual liberal education have make them a matter of no secondary importance first of all before induct him into the greek science he drill him in sacred study require him to learn and recite every day nor be this irksome to the boy but he be eager and diligent in these study and he be not satisfied with learn what be simple and obvious in the sacred word but sought for something more and even at that age busy himself with deeper speculation so that he puzzle his father with inquiry for the true meaning of the inspire scripture and his father rebuke him seemingly to his face tell him not to search beyond his age or far than the manifest meaning but by himself he rejoice greatly and thanked god the author of all good that he have deem him worthy to be the father of such a child and they say that often stand by the boy when asleep he uncovered his breast a if the divine spirit be enshrine within it and kiss it reverently consider himself bless in his goodly offspring these and other thing like them be related to origen when a boy but when his father end his life in martyrdom he be left with his mother and six young brother when he be not quite seventeen year old and the poverty of his father be confiscate to the royal treasury he and his family be in want of the necessary of life but he be deem worthy of divine care and he found welcome and rest with a woman of great wealth and distinguish in her manner of life and in other respect she be treat with great honor a famous heretic then in alexandria who however be born in antioch he be with her a an adopt son and she treat him with the great kindness but although origen be under the necessity of associate with him he nevertheless give from this time on strong evidence of his orthodoxy in the faith for when on account of the apparent skill in argument of paul for this be the man name a great multitude come to him not only of heretic but also of our people origen could never be induced to join with him in prayer for he held although a boy the rule of the church and abominate a he somewhere express it heretical teaching have be instruct in the science of the greek by his father he devote him after his death more assiduously and exclusively to the study of literature so that he obtain considerable preparation in philology and be able not long after the death of his father by devote himself to that subject to earn a compensation amply sufficient for his need at his age chapter while still very young he taught diligently the word of christ but while he be lecture in the school a he tell u himself and there be no one at alexandria to give instruction in the faith a all be driven away by the threat of persecution some of the heathen come to him to hear the word of god the first of them he say be plutarch who after living well be honor with divine martyrdom the second be heracles a brother of plutarch who after he too have give with him abundant evidence of a philosophic ad ascetic life be esteem worthy to succeed demetrius in the bishopric of alexandria he be in his eighteenth year when he take charge of the catechetical school he be prominent also at this time during the persecution under aquila the governor of alexandria when his name become celebrate among the leader in the faith through the kindness and goodwill which he manifest toward all the holy martyr whether know to him or stranger for not only be he with them while in bond and until their final condemnation but when the holy martyr be lead to death he be very bold and go with them into danger so that a he act bravely and with great boldness salute the martyr with a kiss oftentimes the heathen multitude round about them become infuriate and be on the point of rush upon him but through the help hand of god he escape absolutely and marvelously and this same divine and heavenly power again and again it be impossible to say how often on account of his great zeal and boldness for the word of christ guard him when thus endanger so great be the enmity of the unbeliever toward him on account of the multitude that be instruct by him in the sacred faith that they place band of soldier around the house where he abode thus day by day the persecution burn against him so that the whole city could no longer contain him but he remove from house to house and be driven in every direction because of the multitude who attend upon the divine instruction which he give for his life also exhibit right and admirable conduct accord to the practice of genuine philosophy for they say that his manner of life be a his doctrine and his doctrine a his life therefore by the divine power work with him he arouse a great many to his own zeal but when he saw yet more come to him for instruction and the catechetical school have be entrust to him alone by demetrius who preside over the church he consider the teach of grammatical science inconsistent with training in divine subject and forthwith he give up his grammatical school a unprofitable and a hindrance to sacred learn then with become consideration that he might not need aid from others he dispose of whatever valuable book of ancient literature he possess be satisfied with receive from the purchaser four aboli a day for many year he live philosophically in this manner put away all the incentive of youthful desire through the entire day he endure no small amount of discipline and for the great part of the night he give himself to the study of the divine scripture he restrain himself a much a possible by a most philosophic life sometimes by the discipline of fast again by limited time for sleep and in his zeal he never lay upon a bed but upon the ground most of all he thought that the word of the savior in the gospel should be observe in which he exhorts not to have two coat nor to use shoe nor to occupy oneself with care for the future with a zeal beyond his age he continued in cold and nakedness and go to the very extreme of poverty he greatly astonish those about him and indeed he grieve may of his friend who desire to share their possession with him on account of the wearisome toil which they saw him endure in the teach of divine thing but he do not relax his perseverance he be say to have walk for a number of year never wear a shoe and for a great many year to have abstain from the use of wine and of all other thing beyond his necessary food so that he be in danger of break down and destroy his constitution by give such evidence of a philosophic life to those who saw him he arouse may of his pupil to similar zeal so that prominent men even of the unbelieving heathen and men that follow learn and philosophy be lead to his instruction some of them have receive from hi into the depth of their soul faith in the divine word become prominent in the persecution then prevail and some of them be seize and suffer martyrdom chapter the pupil of origen that become martyr the first of thee be plutarch who be mention just above a he be lead to death the man of whom we be speak be with him at the end of hiss life come near be slain by his fellowcitizens a if he be the cause of his death but the providence of god preserve him at this time also after plutarch the second martyr among the pupil of origen be serenus who give through fire a proof of the faith which he have receive the third martyr from the same school be heraclides and after him the fourth be hero the former of these be a yet a catechumen and the latter have but recently be baptize both of them be behead after them the fifth from the same school proclaim a an athlete of piety be another serenus who it be report be behead after a long endurance of torture and of woman herais die while yet a catechumen receive baptism by fire a origen himself somewhere say chapter v potamiaena basilides may be count the seventh of these he lead to martyrdom the celebrate potamiaena who be still famous among the people of the country for the many thing which she endure for the preservation of her chastity and virginity for she be blooming in the perfection of her mind and her physical grace have suffer much for the faith of christ finally after torture dreadful and terrible to speak of she with her mother marcella be put to death by fire they say that the judge aquila by name have inflict severe torture upon her entire body at last threaten to hand her over to the gladiator for bodily abuse after a little consideration be ask for her decision she make a reply which be regard a impious thereupon she receive sentence immediately and basilides one of the officer of the army lead her to death but a the people attempt to annoy and insult her with abusive word he drove back her insulters show her much pity and kindness and perceive the man sympathy for her she exhort him to be of good courage for she would supplicate her lord for him after her departure and he would soon receive a reward for the kindness he have show her have say this she nobly sustain the issue burning pitch be pour little by little over various part of her body from the sole of her foot to the crown of her head such be the conflict endure by this famous maiden not long after this basilides be ask by his fellowsoldiers to swear for a certain reason declare that it be not lawful for him to swear at all for he be a christian and he confess this openly at first they thought that he be jesting but when he continued to affirm it he be lead to the judge and acknowledge his conviction before him he be imprison but the brother in god come to him and inquire the reason of this sudden and remarkable resolution he be report to have say that potamiaena for three day after her martyrdom stood beside him by night and place a crown on his head and say that she have besought the lord for him and have obtain what she ask and that soon she would take him with her thereupon the brother give him the seal of the lord and on the next day after give glorious testimony for the lord he be behead and many others in alexandria be record to have accepted speedily the word of christ in those time for potamiaena appear to them in their dream and exhort them but let this suffice in regard to this matter chapter clement of alexandria clement have succeed pantaenus have charge at that time of the catechetical instruction in alexandria so that origen also while still a boy be one of his pupil in the first book of the work call stroma which clement write he give a chronological table bring event down to the death of commodus so it be evident that that work be write during the reign of severus whose time we be now record chapter the writer juda at this time another writer juda discourse about the seventy week in daniel brings down the chronology to the tenth year of the reign of severus he thought that the come of antichrist which be much talk about be then near so greatly do the agitation cause by the persecution of our people at this time disturb the mind of many chapter origen dare deed at this time while origen be conduct catechetical instruction at alexandria a deed be do by him which evidence an immature and youthful mind but at the same time give the high proof of faith and continence for he take the word there be eunuch who have make themselves eunuch for the kingdom of heaven sake in too literal ad extreme a sense and in order to fulfill the savior word and at the same time to take away from the unbeliever all opportunity for scandal for although young he met for the study of divine thing with woman a well a men he carry out in action the word of the savior he thought that this would not be know by many of his acquaintance but it be impossible for him though desire to do so to keep such an action secret when demetrius who preside over that parish at last learn of this he admire greatly the dare nature of the act and a he perceive his zeal and the genuineness of his faith he immediately exhort him to courage and urge him the more to continue his work of catechetical instruction such be he at that time but soon afterward see that he be prosper and become great and distinguish among all men the same demetrius overcome by human weakness write of his deed a most foolish to the bishop throughout the world but the bishop of cesarea and jerusalem who be especially notable and distinguish among the bishop of palestine consider origen worthy in the high degree of the honor ordain him a presbyter thereupon his fame increase greatly and his name become renowned everywhere and he obtain no small reputation for virtue and wisdom but demetrius have nothing else that he could say against him save this deed of his boyhood accuse him bitterly and dare to include with him in these accusation those who have raise him to the presbyterate these thing however take place a little later but at this time origen continued fearlessly the instruction in divine thing at alexandria by day and night to all who come to him devote his entire leisure without cessation to divine study and to his pupil severus have held the government for eighteen year be succeed by his son antoninus among those who have endure courageously the persecution of that time and have be preserve by the providence of god through the conflict of confession be alexander of whom we have spoken already a bishop of the church in jerusalem on account of his preeminence in the confession of christ he be thought worthy of that bishopric while narcissus his predecessor be still living chapter the miracle of narcissus the citizen of that parish mention many other miracle of narcissus on the tradition of the brother who succeed him among which they relate the follow wonder a perform by him they say that the oil once fail while the deacon be watch through the night at the great paschal vigil thereupon the whole multitude be dismayed narcissus direct those who attend to the light to draw water and bring it to him this be immediately do he prayed over the water and with firm faith in the lord command them to pour it into the lamp and when they have do so contrary to all expectation by a wonderful and divine power the nature of the water be change into that of oil a small portion of it have be preserve even to our day by many of the brother there a a memento of the wonder they tell many other thing worthy to be note of the life of this man among which be this certain base men be unable to endure the strength and firmness of his life and fear punishment for the many evil deed of which they be conscious sought by plot to anticipate him and circulate a terrible slander against him and to persuade those who heard of it they confirm their accusation with oath one invoked upon himself destruction by fire another the waste of his body by a foul disease the third the loss of his eye but though they swore in this manner they could not affect the mind of the believer because the continence and virtuous life of narcissus be well know to all but he could not in any wise endure the wickedness of these men and a he have follow a philosophic life for a long time he flee from the whole body of the church and hid himself in desert and secret place and remain there many year but the great eye of judgment be not unmoved by these thing but soon look down upon these impious men and brought on them the curse with which they have bound themselves the residence of the first from nothing but a little spark fail upon it be entirely consume by night and he perish with all his family the second be speedily cover with the disease which he have imprecate upon himself from the sole of his foot to his head but the third perceive what have happen to the others and fear the inevitable judgment of god the ruler of all confess publicly what they have plot together and in his repentance he become so waste by his great lamentation and continued weep to such an extent that both his eye be destroyed such be the punishment which these men receive for their falsehood chapter the bishop of jerusalem narcissus have depart and no one know where he be those preside over the neighbor church thought it best to ordain another bishop his name be dius he preside but a short time and germanio succeed him he be follow by gordius in whose time narcissus appear again a if raise from the dead and immediately the brother besought him to take the episcopate a all admire him the more on account of his retirement and philosophy and especially because of the punishment with which god have avenge him chapter alexander but a on account of his great age narcissus be no longer able to perform his official duty the providence of god call to the office with him by a revelation give him in a night vision the abovementioned alexander who be then bishop of another parish thereupon a by divine direction he journeyed from the land of cappadocia where he first held the episcopate to jerusalem in consequence of a vow and for the sake of information in regard to it place they receive him there with great cordiality and would not permit him to return because of another revelation see by them at night which uttered the clearest message to the most zealous among them for it make know that if they would go outside the gate they would receive the bishop foreordain for them by god and have do this with the unanimous consent of the bishop of the neighbor church they constrain him to remain alexander himself in private letter to the antinoites which be still preserve among u mention the joint episcopate of narcissus and himself write in these word at the end of the epistle narcissus salute you who held the episcopate here before me and be now associate with me in prayer be one hundred and sixteen year of age and he exhorts you a i do to be of one mind these thing take place in this manner but on the death of serapion asclepiades who have be himself distinguish among the confessor during the persecution succeed to the episcopate of the church at antioch alexander alludes to his appointment write thus to the church at antioch alexander a servant and prisoner of jesus christ to the bless church of antioch greet in the lord the lord hath make my bond during the time of my imprisonment light and easy since i learn that by the divine providence asclepiades who in regard to the true faith be eminently qualify have undertaken the bishopric of your holy church at antioch he indicates that he sent this epistle by clement write toward it close a follow my honor brother have sent this letter to you by clement the bless presbyter a man virtuous and approve whom ye yourselves also know and will recognize be here in the providence and oversight of the master he have strengthen and built up the church of the lord chapter serapion and his extant work it be probable that others have preserve other memorial of serapions literary industry but there have reach u only those address to a certain domninus who in the time of persecution fell away from faith in christ to the jewish willworship and those address to pontius and caricus ecclesiastical men and other letter to different person and still another work compose by him on the socalled gospel of peter he write this last to refute the falsehood which that gospel contain on account of some in the parish of rhossus who have be lead astray by it into heterodox notion it may be well to give some brief extract from his work show his opinion of the book he writes a follow for we brother receive both peter and the other apostle a christ but we reject intelligently the writing falsely ascribed to them know that such be not hand down to u when i visit you i suppose that all of you held the true faith and a i have not read the gospel which they put forward under the name of peter i say if this be the only thing which occasion dispute among you let it be read but now have learn from what have be told me that their mind be involve in some heresy i will hasten to come to you again therefore brother expect me shortly but you will learn brother from what have be write to you that we perceive the nature of the heresy of marcianus and that not understand what he be say he contradict himself for have obtain this gospel from others who have study it diligently namely from the successor of those who first use it whom we call docetae for most of their opinion be connect with the teach of that school we have be able to read it through and we find many thing in accordance with the true doctrine of the savior but some thing add to that doctrine which we have point out for you farther on so much in regard to serapion chapter the writing of clement all the eight stroma of clement be preserve among u and have be give by him the follow title titus flavius clements stroma of gnostic note on the true philosophy the book entitle hypotyposes be of the same number in them he mention pantaenus by name a his teacher and give his opinion and tradition besides these there be his hortatory discourse address to the greek three book of a work entitle the instructor another with the title what rich man be save the work on the passover discussion on fast and on evil speak the hortatory discourse on patience or to those recently baptize and the one bearing the title ecclesiastical canon or against the judaizers which he dedicate to alexander the bishop mention above in the stroma he have not only treat extensively of the divine scripture but he also quote from the greek writer whenever anything that they have say seem to him profitable he elucidates the opinion of many both greek and barbarian he also refutes the false doctrine of the heresiarchs and besides this review a large portion of history give u specimen of very various learn with all the rest he mingles the view of philosopher it be likely that on this account he give his work the appropriate title of stroma he make use also in these work of testimony from the dispute scripture the socalled wisdom of solomon and of jesus the son of sirach and the epistle to the hebrew and those of barnabas and clement and jude he mention also tatians discourse to the greek and speaks of cassianus a the author of a chronological work he refers to the jewish author philo aristobulus josephus demetrius and eupolemus a show all of them in their work that moses and the jewish race exist before the early origin of the greek these book abound also in much other learn in the first of them the author speaks of himself a next after the successor of the apostle in them he promise also to write a commentary on genesis in his book on the passover he acknowledges that he have be urge by his friend to commit to write for posterity the tradition which he have heard from the ancient presbyter and in the same work he mention melito and irenaeus and certain others and give extract from their writing chapter the scripture mention by him to sum up briefly he have give in the hypotyposes abridge account of all canonical scripture not omit the dispute book i refer to jude and the other catholic epistle and barnabas and the socalled apocalypse of peter he say that the epistle to the hebrew be the work of paul and that it be write to the hebrew in the hebrew language but that luke translate it carefully and publish it for the greek and hence the same style of expression be found in this epistle and in the act but he say that the word paul the apostle be probably not prefixed because in send it to the hebrew who be prejudice and suspicious of him he wisely do not wish to repel them at the very begin by give his name farther on he say but now a the bless presbyter say since the lord be the apostle of the almighty be sent to the hebrew paul a sent to the gentile on account of his modesty do not subscribe himself an apostle of the hebrew through respect for the lord and because be a herald and apostle of the gentile he write to the hebrew out of his superabundance again in the same book clement give the tradition of the early presbyter a to the order of the gospel in the follow manner the gospel contain the genealogy he say be write first the gospel accord to mark have this occasion a peter have preach the word publicly at rome and declare the gospel by the spirit many who be present request that mark who have follow him for a long time and remember his saying should write them out and have compose the gospel he give it to those who have request it when peter learn of this he neither directly for bade nor encourage it but last of all john perceive that the external fact have be make plain in the gospel be urge by his friend and inspire by the spirit compose a spiritual gospel this be the account of clement again the abovementioned alexander in a certain letter to origen refers to clement and at the same time to pantaenus a be among his familiar acquaintance he writes a follow for this a thou knowest be the will of god that the ancestral friendship exist between u should remain unshaken nay rather should be warmer and strong for we know well those bless father who have trodden the way before u with whom we shall soon be pantaenus the truly bless man and master and the holy clement my master and benefactor and if there be any other like them through whom i become acquaint with thee the best in everything my master and brother so much for these matter but adamantius for this also be a name of origen when zephyrinus be bishop of rome visit rome desire a he himself somewhere say to see the most ancient church of rome after a short stay there he return to alexandria and he perform the duty of catechetical instruction there with great zeal demetrius who be bishop there at that time urge and even entreat him to work diligently for the benefit of the brother chapter heraclas but when he saw that he have not time for the deeper study of divine thing and for the investigation and interpretation of the sacred scripture and also for the instruction of those who come to him for come one after another from morning till even to be taught by him they scarcely give him time to breathe he divide the multitude and from those whom he knew well he select heraclas who be a zealous student of divine thing and in other respect a very learn man not ignorant of philosophy and make him his associate in the work of instruction he entrust to him the elementary training of beginner but reserve for himself the teach of those who be farther advanced chapter origen s earnest study of the divine scripture so earnest and assiduous be origen research into the divine word that he learn the hebrew language and procure a his own the original hebrew scripture which be in the hand of the jew he investigate also the work of other translator of the sacred scripture besides the seventy and in addition to the wellknown translation of aquila symmachus and theodotion he discover certain others which have be conceal from remote time in what outoftheway corner i know not and by his search he brought them to light since he do not know the author he simply state that he have found this one in nicopolis near actium and that one in some other place in the hexapla of the psalm after the four prominent translation he add not only a fifth but also a sixth and seventh he state of one of these that he found it in a jar in jericho in the time of antoninus the son of severus have collect all of these he divide them into section and place them opposite each other with the hebrew text itself he thus left u the copy of the socalled hexapla he arrange also separately an edition of aquila and symmachus and theodotion with the septuagint in the tetrapla chapter the translator symmachus a to these translator it should be state that symmachus be an ebionite but the heresy of the ebionite a it be call asserts that christ be the son of joseph and mary consider him a mere man and insists strongly on keep the law in a jewish manner a we have see already in this history commentary of symmachus be still extant in which he appear to support this heresy by attack the gospel of matthew origen state that he obtain these and other commentary of symmachus on the scripture from a certain juliana who he say receive the book by inheritance from symmachus himself chapter ambrose about this time ambrose who held the heresy of valentinus be convince by origen presentation of the truth and a if his mind be illumine by light he accepted the orthodox doctrine of the church many others also drawn by the fame of origen learn which resound everywhere come to him to make trial of his skill in sacred literature and a great many heretic and not a few of the most distinguish philosopher study under him diligently receive instruction from him not only in divine thing but also in secular philosophy for when he perceive that any person have superior intelligence he instruct them also in philosophic branch in geometry arithmetic and other preparatory study and then advanced to the system of the philosopher and explain their writing and he make observation and comment upon each of them so that he become celebrate a a great philosopher even among the greek themselves and he instruct many of the less learn in the common school branch say that these would be no small help to them in the study and understand of the divine scripture on this account he consider it especially necessary for himself to be skilled in secular and philosophic learn chapter circumstance related of origen the greek philosopher of his age be witness to his proficiency in these subject we find frequent mention of him in their writing sometimes they dedicate their own work to him again they submit their labor to him a a teacher for his judgment why need we say these thing when even porphyry who live in sicily in our own time and write book against u attempt to traduce the divine scripture by them mention those who have interpret them and be unable in any way to find a base accusation against the doctrine for lack of argument turn to revile and calumniate their interpreter attempt especially to slander origen whom he say he knew in his youth but truly without know it he commends the man tell the truth about him in some case where he could not do otherwise but utter falsehood where he think he will not be detect sometimes he accuses him a a christian again he describes his proficiency in philosophic learn but hear his own word some person desire to find a solution of the baseness of the jewish scripture rather than abandon them have have recourse to explanation inconsistent and incongruous with the word write which explanation instead of supply a defense of the foreigner contain rather approval and praise of themselves for they boast that the plain word of moses be enigma and regard them a oracle full of hidden mystery and have bewilder the mental judgment by folly they make their explanation farther on he say a an example of this absurdity take a man whom i met when i be young and who be then greatly celebrate and still be on account of the writing which he have left i refer to origen who be highly honor by the teacher of these doctrine for this man have be a hearer of ammonius who have attain the great proficiency in philosophy of any in our day derive much benefit from his teacher in the knowledge of the science but a to the correct choice of life he pursue a course opposite to his for ammonius be a christian and brought up by christian parent when he give himself to study and to philosophy straightway conform to the life require by the law but origen have be educate a a greek in greek literature go over to the barbarian recklessness and carry over the learn which he have obtain he hawk it about in his life conduct himself a a christian and contrary to the law but in his opinion of material thing and of the deity be like a greek and mingle grecian teaching with foreign fable for he be continually study plato and he busy himself with the writing of numenius and cronius apollophanes longinus moderatus and nicomachus and those famous among the pythagoreans and he use the book of chaeremon the stoic and of cornutus become acquaint through them with the figurative interpretation of the grecian mystery he apply it to the jewish scripture these thing be say by porphyry in the third book of his work against the christian he speaks truly of the industry and learn of the man but plainly utters a falsehood for what will not an opposer of christian do when he say that he go over from the greek and that ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen custom for the doctrine of christ be taught to origen by his parent a we have show above and ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life his work yet extant show this a he be celebrate among many for the writing which he have left for example the work entitle the harmony of moses and jesus and such others a be in the possession of the learn these thing be sufficient to evince the slander of the false accuser and also the proficiency of origen in grecian learn he defends his diligence in this direction against some who blame him for it in a certain epistle where he writes a follow when i devote myself to the word and the fame of my proficiency go abroad and when heretic and person conversant with grecian learn and particularly with philosophy come to me it seem necessary that i should examine the doctrine of the heretic and what the philosopher say concern the truth and in this we have follow pantaenus who benefit many before our time by his thorough preparation in such thing and also heraclas who be now a member of the presbytery of alexandria i found him with the teacher of philosophic learn with whom he have already continued five year before i begin to hear lecture on those subject and though he have formerly worn the common dress he laid it aside and assume and still wear the philosopher garment and he continue the earnest investigation of greek work he say these thing in defend himself for his study of grecian literature about this time while he be still at alexandria a soldier come and deliver a letter from the governor of arabia to demetrius bishop of the parish and to the prefect of egypt who be in office at that time request that they would with all speed send origen to him for an interview be sent by them he go to arabia and have in a short time accomplish the object of his visit he return to alexandria but sometime after a considerable war broke out in the city and he depart from alexandria and think that it would be unsafe for him to remain in egypt he go to palestine and abode in caesarea while there the bishop of the church in that country request him to preach and expound the scripture publicly although he have not yet be ordain a presbyter this be evident from what alexander bishop of jerusalem and theoctistus of caesarea write to demetrius in regard to the matter defend themselves thus he have state in his letter that such a thing be never heard of before neither have hitherto take place that layman should preach in the presence of bishop i know not how he come to say what be plainly untrue for whenever person able to instruct the brother be found they be exhort by the holy bishop to preach to the people thus in laranda euelpis by neon and in iconium paulinus by celsus and in synada theodorus by atticus our bless brother and probably this have be do in other place unknown to u he be honor in this manner while yet a young man not only by his countryman but also by foreign bishop but demetrius sent for him by letter and urge him through member and deacon of the church to return to alexandria so he return and resume his accustom duty chapter the extant work of the writer of that age there flourish many learn men in the church at that time whose letter to each other have be preserve and be easily accessible they have be kept until our time in the library at aelia which be establish by alexander who at that time preside over that church we have be able to gather from that library material for our present work among these beryllus have left u besides letter and treatise various elegant work he be bishop of bostra in arabia likewise also hippolytus who preside over another church have left writing there have reach u also a dialogue of caius a very learn man which be held at rome under zephyrinus with proclus who contend for the phrygian heresy in this he curb the rashness and boldness of his opponent in set forth new scripture he mention only thirteen epistle of the holy apostle not counting that to the hebrew with the others and unto our day there be some among the roman who do not consider this a work of the apostle chapter the bishop that be well know at that time after antoninus have reign seven year and six month macrinus succeed him he held the government but a year and be succeed by another antoninus during his first year the roman bishop zephyrinus have held his office for eighteen year die and callistus receive the episcopate he continued for five year and be succeed by urbanus after this alexander become roman emperor antoninus have reign but four year at this time philetus also succeed asclepiades in the church of antioch the mother of the emperor mammaea by name be a most pious woman if there ever be one and of religious life when the fame of origen have extend everywhere and have come even to her ear she desire greatly to see the man and above all thing to make trial of his celebrate understand of divine thing stay for a time in antioch she sent for him with a military escort have remain with her a while and show her many thing which be for the glory of the lord and of the excellence of the divine teach he hasten back to his accustom work chapter the work of hippolytus which have reach u at that time hippolytus besides many other treatise write a work on the passover he give in this a chronological table and present a certain paschal canon of sixteen year bring the time down to the first year of the emperor alexander of his other writing the follow have reach u on the hexaemeron on the work after the hexaemeron against marcion on the song of song on portion of ezekiel on the passover against all the heresy and you can find many other work preserve by many chapter origen zeal and his elevation to the presbyterate at that time origen begin his commentary on the divine scripture be urge thereto by ambrose who employ innumerable incentive not only exhort him by word but also furnish abundant mean for he dictate to more than seven amanuensis who relieve each other at appoint time and he employ no few copyist besides girl who be skilled in elegant write for all these ambrose furnish the necessary expense in abundance manifest himself an inexpressible earnestness in diligence and zeal for the divine oracle by which he especially press him on to the preparation of his commentary while these thing be in progress urbanus who have be for eight year bishop of the roman church be succeed by pontianus and zebinus succeed philetus in antioch at this time origen be sent to greece on account of a press necessity in connection with ecclesiastical affair and go through palestine and be ordain a presbyter in caesarea by the bishop of that country the matter that be agitate concern him on this account and the decision on these matter by those who preside over the church besides the other work concern the divine word which he publish while in his prime demand a separate treatise we have write of them to some extent in the second book of the defense which we have compose in his behalf chapter the commentary which he prepared at alexandria it may be well to add that in the sixth book of his exposition of the gospel of john he state that he prepared the first five while in alexandria of his work on the entire gospel only twentytwo volume have come down to u in the ninth of those on genesis of which there be twelve in all he state that not only the precede eight have be compose at alexandria but also those on the first twentyfive psalm and on lamentation of these last five volume have reach u in them he mention also his book on the resurrection of which there be two he write also the book de principiis before leave alexandria and the discourse entitle stroma ten in number he compose in the same city during the reign of alexander a the note by his own hand precede the volume indicate chapter his review of the canonical scripture when expound the first psalm hei give a catalogue of the sacred scripture of the old testament a follow it should be state that the canonical book a the hebrew have hand them down be twentytwo correspond with the number of their letter farther on he say the twentytwo book of the hebrew be the follow that which be call by u genesis but by the hebrew from the begin of the book bresith which mean in the begin exodus welesmoth that be these be the name leviticus wikra and he call number ammesphekodeim deuteronomy eleaddebareim these be the word jesus the son of nave josoue ben noun judge and ruth among them in one book saphateim the first and second of king among them one samouel that be the call of god the third and fourth of king in one wammelch david that be the kingdom of david of the chronicle the first and second in one dabreiamein that be record of day esdras first and second in one ezra that be an assistant the book of psalm spharthelleim the proverb of solomon meloth ecclesiastes koelth the song of song not a some suppose song of song sir hassirim isaiah jessia jeremiah with lamentation and the epistle in one jeremia daniel daniel ezekiel jezekiel job job esther esther and besides these there be the maccabees which be entitle sarbeth sabanaiel he give these in the abovementioned work in his first book on matthew gospel maintain the canon of the church he testifies that he know only four gospel write a follow among the four gospel which be the only indisputable one in the church of god under heaven i have learn by tradition that the first be write by matthew who be once a publican but afterwards an apostle of jesus christ and it be prepared for the convert from judaism and publish in the hebrew language the second be by mark who compose it accord to the instruction of peter who in his catholic epistle acknowledges him a a son say the church that be at babylon elect together with you saluteth you and so doth marcus my son and the third by luke the gospel commend by paul and compose for gentile convert last of all that by john in the fifth book of his exposition of john gospel he speaks thus concern the epistle of the apostle but he who be make sufficient to be a minister of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit that be paul who fully preach the gospel from jerusalem and round about even unto illyricum do not write to all the church which he have instruct and to those to which he write he sent but few line and peter on whom the church of christ be built against which the gate of hell shall not prevail have left one acknowledge epistle perhaps also a second but this be doubtful why need we speak of him who recline upon the bosom of jesus john who have left u one gospel though he confess that he might write so many that the world could not contain them and he write also the apocalypse but be command to keep silence and not to write the word of the seven thunder he have left also an epistle of very few line perhaps also a second and third but not all consider them genuine and together they do not contain hundred line in addition he make the follow statement in regard to the epistle to the hebrew in his homily upon it that the verbal style of the epistle entitle to the hebrew be not rude like the language of the apostle who acknowledge himself rude in speech that be in expression but that it diction be purer greek any one who have the power to discern difference of phraseology will acknowledge moreover that the thought of the epistle be admirable and not inferior to the acknowledge apostolic writing any one who carefully examines the apostolic text will admit farther on he add if i give my opinion i should say that the thought be those of the apostle but the diction and phraseology be those of some one who remember the apostolic teaching and write down at his leisure what have be say by his teacher therefore if any church hold that this epistle be by paul let it be commend for this for not without reason have the ancient hand it down a paul but who write the epistle in truth god know the statement of some who have go before u be that clement bishop of the roman write the epistle and of others that luke the author of the gospel and the act write it but let this suffice on these matter chapter heraclas becomes bishop of alexandria it be in the tenth year of the abovementioned reign that origen remove from alexandria to caesarea leave the charge of the catechetical school in that city to heraclas not long afterward demetrius bishop of the church of alexandria die have held the office for fortythree full year and heraclas succeed him at this time firmilianus bishop of caesarea in cappadocia be conspicuous chapter how the bishop regard origen he be so earnestly affected toward origen that he urge him to come to that country for the benefit of the church and moreover he visit him in judea remain with him for some time for the sake of improvement in divine thing and alexander bishop of jerusalem and theoctistus bishop of caesarea attend on him constantly a their only teacher and allow him to expound the divine scripture and to perform the other duty pertain to ecclesiastical discourse chapter the persecution under maximinus the roman emperor alexander have finish his reign in thirteen year be succeed by maximinus caesar on account of his hatred toward the household of alexander which contain many believer he begin a persecution command that only the ruler of the church should be put to death a responsible for the gospel teach thereupon origen compose his work on martyrdom and dedicate it to ambrose and protoctetus a presbyter of the parish of caesarea because in the persecution there have come upon them both unusual hardship in which it be report that they be eminent in confession during the reign of maximinus which last but three year origen have note this a the time of the persecution in the twentysecond book of his commentary on john and in several epistle chapter fabianus who be wonderfully designate bishop of rome by god gordianus succeed maximinus a roman emperor and pontianus who have be bishop of the church at rome for six year be succeed by anteros after he have held the office for a month fabianus succeed him they say that fabianus have come after the death of anteros with others from the country be stay at rome and that while there he be chosen to the office through a most wonderful manifestation of divine and heavenly grace for when all the brother have assemble to select by vote him who should succeed to the episcopate of the church several renowned and honorable men be in the mind of many but fabianus although present be in the mind of none but they relate that suddenly a dove fly down light on his head resemble the descent of the holy spirit on the savior in the form of a dove thereupon all the people a if move by one divine spirit with all eagerness and unanimity cry out that he be worthy and without delay they take him and place him upon the episcopal seat about that time zebinus bishop of antioch die and babylas succeed him and in alexandria heraclas have receive the episcopal office after demetrius be succeed in the charge of the catechetical school by dionysius who have also be one of origen pupil chapter the pupil of origen while origen be carry on his customary duty in caesarea many pupil come to him not only from the vicinity but also from other country among these theodorus the same that be distinguish among the bishop of our day under the name of gregory and his brother athenodorus we know to have be especially celebrate find them deeply interested in greek and roman learn he infuse into them a love of philosophy and lead them to exchange their old zeal for the study of divinity remain with him five year they make such progress in divine thing that although they be still young both of them be honor with a bishopric in the church of pontus chapter africanus at this time also africanus the writer of the book entitle cesti be well know there be extant an epistle of his to origen express doubt of the story of susannah in daniel a be spurious and fictitious origen answer this very fully other work of the same africanus which have reach u be his five book on chronology a work accurately and laboriously prepared he say in this that he go to alexandria on account of the great fame of heraclas who excel especially in philosophic study and other greek learn and whose appointment to the bishopric of the church there we have already mention there be extant also another epistle from the same africanus to aristides on the suppose discrepancy between matthew and luke in the genealogy of christ in this he show clearly the agreement of the evangelist from an account which have come down to him which we have already give in it proper place in the first book of this work chapter the commentary which origen compose in caesarea in palestine about this time origen prepared his commentary on isaiah and on ezekiel of the former there have come down to u thirty book a far a the third part of isaiah to the vision of the beast in the desert on ezekiel twentyfive book which be all that he write on the whole prophet be at that time in athens he finish his work on ezekiel and commenced his commentary on the song of song which he carry forward to the fifth book after his return to caesarea he complete these also ten book in number but why should we give in this history an accurate catalogue of the man work which would require a separate treatise we have furnish this also in our narrative of the life of pamphilus a holy martyr of our own time after show how great the diligence of pamphilus be in divine thing we give in that a catalogue of the library which he collect of the work of origen and of other ecclesiastical writer whoever desire may learn readily from this which of origen work have reach u but we must proceed now with our history chapter the error of beryllus beryllus whom we mention recently a bishop of bostra in arabia turn aside from the ecclesiastical standard and attempt to introduce idea foreign to the faith he dare to assert that our savior and lord do not preexist in a distinct form of be of his own before his abode among men and that he do not posse a divinity of his own but only that of the father dwell in him many bishop carry on investigation and discussion with him on this matter and origen have be invite with the others go down at first for a conference with him to ascertain his real opinion but when he understood his view and perceive that they be erroneous have persuade him by argument and convince him by demonstration he brought him back to the true doctrine and restore him to his former sound opinion there be still extant writing of beryllus and of the synod held on his account which contain the question put to him by origen and the discussion which be carry on in his parish a well a all the thing do at that time the elder brother among u s have hand down many other fact respect origen which i think proper to omit a not pertain to this work but whatever it have seem necessary to record about him can be found in the apology in his behalf write by u and pamphilus the holy martyr of our day we prepared this carefully and do the work jointly on account of faultfinder chapter philip caesar gordianus have be roman emperor for six year when philip with his son philip succeed him it be report that he be a christian desire on the day of the last paschal vigil to share with the multitude in the prayer of the church but that he be not permit to enter by him who then preside until he have make confession and have numbered himself among those who be reckon a transgressor and who occupy the place of penance for if he have not do this he would never have be receive by him on account of the many crime which he have commit it be say that he obeyed readily manifest in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of god chapter dionysius succeed heraclas in the episcopate in the third year of this emperor heraclas die have held his office for sixteen year and dionysius receive the episcopate of the church of alexandria chapter other work of origen at this time a the faith extend and our doctrine be proclaim boldly before all origen be a they say over sixty year old and have gain great facility by his long practice very properly permit his public discourse to be take down by stenographer a thing which he have never before allow he also at this

the dissension of the arabian about the same time others arose in arabia put forward a doctrine foreign to the truth they say that during the present time the human soul dy and perishes with the body but that at the time of the resurrection they will be renew together and at that time also a synod of considerable size assemble and origen be again invite thither spoke publicly on the question with such effect that the opinion of those who have formerly fall be change chapter the heresy of the elkesites another error also arose at this time call the heresy of the elkesites which be extinguish in the very begin origen speaks of it in this manner in a public homily on the eightysecond psalm a certain man come just now puffed up greatly with his own ability proclaim that godless and impious opinion which have appear lately in the church style of the elkesites i will show you what evil thing that opinion teach that you may not be carry away by it it reject certain part of every scripture again it us portion of the old testament and the gospel but reject the apostle altogether it say that to deny christ be an indifferent matter and that he who understands will under necessity deny with his mouth but not in his heart they produce a certain book which they say fell from heaven they hold that whoever hears and believe this shall receive remission of sin another remission than that which jesus christ have give such be the account of these person chapter the persecution under decius and the suffering of origen after a reign of seven year philip be succeed by decius on account of his hatred of philip he commenced a persecution of the church in which fabianus suffer martyrdom at rome and cornelius succeed him in the episcopate in palestine alexander bishop of the church of jerusalem be brought again on christ account before the governor judgment seat in caesarea and have acquit himself nobly in a second confession be cast into prison crown with the hoary lock of venerable age and after his honorable and illustrious confession at the tribunal of the governor he fell asleep in prison and mazabanes become his successor in the bishopric of jerusalem babylas in antioch have like alexander pass awayin prison after hi confession be succeed by fabius in the episcopate of that church but how many and how great thing come upon origen in the persecution and what be their final result a the demon of evil marshal all his force and fought against the man with his utmost craft and power assault him beyond all others against whom he contend at that time and what and how many thing he endure for the word of christ bond and bodily torture and torment under the iron collar and in the dungeon and how for many day with his foot stretch four space in the stooks he bore patiently the threat of fire and whatever other thing be inflict by his enemy and how his suffering terminate a his judge strove eagerly with all his might not to end his life and what word he left after these thing full of comfort to those need aid a great many of his epistle show with truth and accuracy chapter the event which happen to dionysius i shall quote from the epistle of dionysius to germanus an account of what befell the former speak of himself he writes a follow i speak before god and he know that i do not lie i do not flee on my own impulse nor without divine direction but even before this at the very hour when the decian persecution be command sabinus sent a frumentarius to search for me and i remain at home four day await his arrival but he go about examine all place road river and field where he thought i might be conceal or on the way but he be smitten with blindness and do not find the house for he do not suppose that be pursue i would remain at home and after the fourth day god command me to depart and make a way for me in a wonderful manner and i and my attendant and many of the brother go away together and that this occur through the providence of god be make manifest by what follow in which perhaps we be useful to some farther on he relates in this manner what happen to him after his flight for about sunset have be seize with those that be with me i be take by the soldier to taposiris but in the providence of god timothy be not present and be not capture but come later he found the house desert and guard by soldier and ourselves reduce to slavery after a little he say and what be the manner of his admirable management for the truth shall be told one of the country people met timothy flee and disturbed and inquire the cause of his haste and he told him the truth and when the man heard it he be on his way to a marriage feast for it be customary to spend the entire night in such gathering he enter and announce it to those at the table and they a if on a preconcerted signal arose with one impulse and rush out quickly and come and burst in upon u with a shout immediately the soldier who be guard u flee and they come to u lie a we be upon the bare couch but i god know thought at first that they be robber who have come for spoil and plunder so i remain upon the bed on which i be clothed only in a linen garment and offer them the rest of my clothing which be lie beside me but they direct me to rise and come away quickly then i understood why they be come and i cry out beseeching and entreat them to depart and leave u alone and i request them if they desire to benefit me in any way to anticipate those who be carry me off and cut off my head themselves and when i have cry out in this manner a my companion and partner in everything know they raise me by force but i threw myself on my back on the ground and they seize me by the hand and foot and drag me away and the witness of all these occurrence follow gaius faustus peter and paul but they who have seize me carry me out of the village hastily and place me on an as without a saddle bore me away dionysius relates these thing respect himself chapter the martyr in alexandria the same writer in an epistle to fabius bishop of antioch relates a follow the suffering of the martyr in alexandria under decius the persecution among u do not begin with the royal decree but precede it an entire year the prophet and author of evil to this city whoever he be previously move and arouse against u the mass of the heathen rekindle among them the superstition of their country and be thus excite by him and find full opportunity for any wickedness they consider this the only pious service of their demon that they should slay u they seize first an old man name metras and command him to utter impious word but a he would not obey they beat him with club and tore his face and eye with sharp stick and drag him out of the city and stone him then they carry to their idol temple a faithful woman name quinta that they might force her to worship and a she turn away in detestation they bound her foot and drag her through the entire city over the stonepaved street and dash her against the millstone and at the same time scourge her then take her to the same place they stone her to death then all with one impulse rush to the home of the pious and they drag forth whomsoever any one knew a a neighbor and despoil and plunder them they take for themselves the more valuable property but the poorer article and those make of wood they scatter about and burn in the street so that the city appear a if take by an enemy but the brother withdrew and go away and take joyfully the spoil of their good like those to whom paul bore witness i know of no one unless possibly some one who fell into their hand who up to this time deny the lord then they seize also that most admirable virgin apollonia an old woman and smite her on the jaw broke out all her teeth and they make a fire outside the city and threaten to burn her alive if she would not join with them in their impious cry and she supplicate a little be release when she leap eagerly into the fire and be consume then they seize serapion in his own house and torture him with harsh cruelty and have broken all his limb they threw him headlong from an upper story and there be no street nor public road nor lane open to u by night or day for always and everywhere all of them cry out that if any one would not repeat their impious word he should immediately be drag away and burn and matter continued thus for a considerable time but a sedition and civil war come upon the wretched people and turn their cruelty toward u against one another so we breathe for a little while a they cease from their rage against u but presently the change from that milder reign be announce to u and great fear of what be threaten seize u for the decree arrive almost like unto that most terrible time foretold by our lord which if it be possible would offend even the elect all truly be affright and many of the more eminent in their fear come forward immediately others who be in the public service be drawn on by their official duty others be urge on by their acquaintance and a their name be call they approach the impure and impious sacrifice some of them be pale and tremble a if they be not about to sacrifice but to be themselves sacrifice and offering to the idol so that they be jeered at by the multitude who stood around a it be plain to every one that they be afraid either to die or to sacrifice but some advanced to the altar more readily declare boldly that they have never be christian of these the prediction of our lord be most true that they shall hardly be save of the rest some follow the one others the other of these class some flee and some be seize and of the latter some continued faithful until bond and imprisonment and some who have even be imprison for many day yet abjure the faith before they be brought to trial others have for a time endure great torture finally retract but the firm and bless pillar of the lord be strengthen by him and have receive vigor and might suitable and appropriate to the strong faith which they possess become admirable witness of his kingdom the first of these be julian a man who suffer so much with the gout that he be unable to stand or walk they brought him forward with two others who carry him one of these immediately deny but the other whose name be cronion and whose surname be eunus and the old man julian himself both of them have confess the lord be carry on camel through the entire city which a you know be a very large one and in this elevate position be beaten and finally burn in a fierce fire surround by all the populace but a soldier name besas who stood by them a they be lead away rebuke those who insult them and they cry out against him and this most manly warrior of god be arraign and have do nobly in the great contest for piety be behead a certain other one a libyan by birth but in name and blessedness a true macar be strongly urge by the judge to recant but a he would not yield he be burn alive after them epimachus and alexander have remain in bond for a long time and endure countless agony from scraper and scourge be also consume in a fierce fire and with them there be four woman ammonarium a holy virgin the judge torture relentlessly and excessively because she declare from the first that she would utter none of those thing which he command and have kept her promise truly she be drag away the others be mercuria a very remarkable old woman and dionysia the mother of many child who do not love her own child above the lord a the governor be ashamed of torture thus ineffectually and be always defeat by woman they be put to death by the sword without the trial of torture for the champion ammonarium endure these in behalf of all the egyptian heron and ater and isidorus and with them dioscorus a boy about fifteen year old be deliver up at first the judge attempt to deceive the lad by fair word a if he could be brought over easily and then to force him by torture a one who would readily yield but dioscorus be neither persuade nor constrain a the others remain firm he scourge them cruelly and then deliver them to the fire but admire the manner in which dioscorus have distinguish himself publicly and his wise answer to his persuasion he dismiss him say that on account of his youth he would give him time for repentance and this most godly dioscorus be among u now await a longer conflict and more severe contest but a certain nemesion who also be an egyptian be accuse a an associate of robber but when he have clear himself before the centurion of this charge most foreign to the truth he be inform against a a christian and take in bond before the governor and the most unrighteous magistrate inflict on him torture and scourgings double those which he execute on the robber and then burn him between the robber thus honor the bless man by the likeness to christ a band of soldier ammon and zeno and ptolemy and ingenes and with them an old man theophilus be stand close together before the tribunal and a a certain person who be be try a a christian seem inclined to deny they stand by gnash their teeth and make sign with their face and stretch out their hand and gesture with their body and when the attention of all be turn to them before any one else could seize them they rush up to the tribunal say that they be christian so that the governor and his council be affright and those who be on trial appear most courageous in prospect of their suffering while their judge tremble and they go exultingly from the tribunal rejoice in their testimony god himself have cause them to triumph gloriously chapter others of whom dionysius give an account many others in city and village be torn asunder by the heathen of whom i will mention one a an illustration ischyrion be employ a a steward by one of the ruler his employer command him to sacrifice and on his refusal insult him and a he remain firm abuse him and a he still held out he seize a long staff and thrust it through his bowel and slew him why need i speak of the multitude that wander in the desert and mountain and perish by hunger and thirst and cold and sickness and robber and wild beast those of them who survive be witness of their election and victory but i will relate one occurrence a an example chaeremon who be very old be bishop of the city call nilus he flee with his wife to the arabian mountain and do not return and though the brother search diligently they could not find either them or their body and many who flee to the same arabian mountain be carry into slavery by the barbarian saracen some of them be ransom with difficulty and at a large price others have not be to the present time i have related these thing my brother not without an object but that you may understand how many and great distress come upon u those indeed will understand them the best who have have the large experience of them a little far on he add these divine martyr among u who now be seat with christ and be sharer in his kingdom partaker of his judgment and judge with him receive some of the brother who have fall away and become chargeable with the guilt of sacrifice when they perceive that their conversion and repentance be sufficient to be acceptable with him who by no mean desire the death of the sinner but his repentance have prove them they receive them back and brought them together and met with them and have fellowship with them in prayer and feast what counsel then brother do you give u concern such person what should we do shall we have the same judgment and rule a theirs and observe their decision and charity and show mercy to those whom they pity or shall we declare their decision unrighteous and set ourselves a judge of their opinion and grieve mercy and overturn order these word dionysius very properly add when make mention of those who have be weak in the time of persecution chapter novatus his manner of life and his heresy after this novatus a presbyter of the church at rome be lift up with arrogance against these person a if there be no longer for them a hope of salvation not even if they should do all thing pertain to a genuine and pure conversion become leader of the heresy of those who in the pride of their imagination call themselves cathari there upon a very large synod assemble at rome of bishop in number sixty and a great many more presbyter and deacon while the pastor of the remain province deliberate in their place privately concern what ought to be do a decree be confirm by all that novatus and those who join with him and those who adopt his brotherhating and inhuman opinion should be consider by the church a stranger but that they should heal such of the brother a have fall into misfortune and should minister to them with the medicine of repentance there have reach u epistle of cornelius bishop of rome to fabius of the church at antioch which show what be do at the synod at rome and what seem best to all those in italy and africa and the region thereabout also other epistle write in the latin language of cyprian and those with him in africa which show that they agree a to the necessity of succor those who have be tempt and of cut off from the catholic church the leader of the heresy and all that join with him another epistle of cornelius concern the resolution of the synod be attach to these and yet others on the conduct of novatus from which it be proper for u to make selection that any one who see this work may know about him cornelius informs fabius what sort of a man novatus be in the follow word but that you may know that a long time ago this remarkable man desire the episcopate but kept this ambitious desire to himself and conceal it use a a cloak for his rebellion those confessor who have adhere to him from the begin i desire to speak maximus one of our presbyter and urbanus who twice gain the high honor by confession with sidonius and celerinus a man who by the grace of god most heroically endure all kind of torture and by the strength of his faith overcame the weakness of the flesh and mightily conquer the adversary these men found him out and detect his craft and duplicity his perjury and falsehood his unsociability and cruel friendship and they return to the holy church and proclaim in the presence of many both bishop and presbyter and a large number of the laity all his craft and wickedness which for a long time he have conceal and this they do with lamentation land repentance because through the persuasion of the crafty and malicious beast they have left the church for the time a little farther on he say how remarkable beloved brother the change and transformation which we have see take place in him in a short time for this most illustrious man who bound himself with terrible oath in nowise to seek the bishopric suddenly appear a bishop a if thrown among u by some machine for this dogmatist this defender of the doctrine of the church attempt to grasp and seize the episcopate which have not be give him from above chose two of his companion who have give up their own salvation and he sent them to a small and insignificant corner of italy that there by some counterfeit argument he might deceive three bishop who be rustic and very simple men and they assert positively and strongly that it be necessary that they should come quickly to rome in order that all the dissension which have arisen there might be appease through their mediation jointly with other bishop when they have come be a we have state very simple in the craft and artifice of the wicked they be shut up with certain select men like himself and by the tenth hour when they have become drunk and sick he compel them by force to confer on him the episcopate through a counterfeit and vain imposition of hand because it have not come to him he avenge himself by craft and treachery one of these bishop shortly after come back to the church lament and confess his transgression and we commune with him a with a layman all the people present intercede for him and we ordain successor of the other bishop and sent them to the place where they be this avenger of the gospel then do not know that there should be one bishop in a catholic church yet he be not ignorant for how could he be that in it there be fortysix presbyter seven deacon seven subdeacon fortytwo acolyths fiftytwo exorcist reader and janitor and over fifteen hundred widow and person in distress all of whom the grace and kindness of the master nourish but not even this great multitude so necessary in the church nor those who through god providence be rich and full together with the very many even innumerable people could turn him from such desperation and presumption and recall him to the church again farther on he add these word permit u to say far on account of what work or conduct have he the assurance to contend for the episcopate be it that he have be brought up in the church from the begin and have endure many conflict in her behalf and have pass through many and great danger for religion truly this be not the fact but satan who enter and dwelt in him for a long time become the occasion of his believe be deliver by the exorcist he fell into a severe sickness and a he seem about to die he receive baptism by affusion on the bed where he lay if indeed we can say that such a one do receive it and when he be heal of his sickness he do not receive the other thing which it be necessary to have accord to the canon of the church even the be seal by the bishop and a he do not receive this how could he receive the holy spirit shortly after he say again in the time of persecution through coward ice and love of life he deny that he be a presbyter for when he be request and entreat by the deacon to come out of the chamber in which he have imprison himself and give aid to the brother a far a be lawful and possible for a presbyter to assist those of the brother who be in danger and need help he paid so little respect to the entreaty of the deacon that he go away and depart in anger for he say that he no longer desire to be a presbyter a he be an admirer of another philosophy passing by a few thing he add the follow for this illustrious man forsook the church of god in which when he believe he be judged worthy of the presbyterate through the favor of the bishop who ordain him to the presbyterial office this have be resist by all the clergy and many of the laity because it be unlawful that one who have be affused on his bed on account of sickness a he have be should enter into any clerical office but the bishop request that he might be permit to ordain this one only he add to these yet another the bad of all the man offense a follow for when he have make the offering and distribute a part to each man a he give it he compels the wretched man to swear in place of the blessing hold his hand in both of his own he will not release him until he have sworn in this manner for i will give his own word swear to me by the body and blood of our lord jesus christ that you will never forsake me and turn to cornelius and the unhappy man do not taste until he have call down imprecation on himself and instead of say amen a he take the bread he say i will never return to cornelius farther on he say again but know that he have now be make bare and desolate a the brother leave him every day and return to the church moses also the bless martyr who lately suffer among u a glorious and admirable martyrdom while he be yet alive beholding his boldness and folly refuse to commune with him and with the five presbyter who with him have separate themselves from the church at the close of his letter he give a list of the bishop who have come to rome and condemn the silliness of novatus with their name and the parish over which each of them preside he mention also those who do not come to rome but who express by letter their agreement with the vote of these bishop give their name and the city from which they severally sent them cornelius write these thing to fabius bishop of antioch chapter dionysius account of serapion to this same fabius who seem to lean somewhat toward this schism dionysius of alexandria also write an epistle he writes in this many other thing concern repentance and relates the conflict of those who have lately suffer martyrdom at alexandria after the other account he mention a certain wonderful fact which deserves a place in this work it be a follow i will give thee this one example which occur among u there be with u a certain serapion an age believer who have live for a long time blamelessly but have fall in the trial he besought often but no one give heed to him because he have sacrifice but he become sick and for three successive day continued speechless and senseless have recover somewhat on the fourth day he sent for his daughter son and say how long do you detain me my child i beseech you make haste and absolve me speedily call one of the presbyter to me and when he have say this he become again speechless and the boy ran to the presbyter but it be night and he be sick and therefore unable to come but a i have command that person at the point of death if they request it and especially if they have ask for it previously should receive remission that they might depart with a good hope he give the boy a small portion of the eucharist tell him to soak it and let the drop fall into the old man mouth the boy return with it and a he drew near before he enter serapion again arouse say thou art come my child and the presbyter could not come but do quickly what he direct and let me depart then the boy soak it and drop it into his mouth and when he have swallow a little immediately he give up the ghost be it not evident that he be preserve and his life continued till he be absolve and his sin have be blot out he could be acknowledge for the many good deed which he have do dionysius relates these thing chapter an epistle of dionysius to novatus but let u see how the same man address novatus when he be disturb the roman brotherhood a he pretend that some of the brother be the occasion of his apostasy and schism a if he have be force by them to proceed a he have observe the manner in which he writes to him dionysius to his brother novatus greet if a thou sayest thou hast be lead on unwillingly thou wilt prove this if thou retirest willingly for it be well to suffer everything rather than divide the church of god even martyrdom for the sake of prevent division would not be less glorious than for refuse to worship idol nay to me it seem great for in the one case a man suffers martyrdom for the sake of his own soul in the other case in behalf of the entire church and now if thou canst persuade or induce the brother to come to unanimity thy righteousness will be great than thine error and this will not be count but that will be praise but if thou canst not prevail with the disobedient at least save thine own soul i pray that thou mayst fare well maintain peace in the lord this he write to novatus chapter other epistle of dionysius he write also an epistle to the brother in egypt on repentance in this he set forth what seem proper to him in regard to those who have fall and he describes the class of transgression there be extant also a private letter on repentance which he write to conon bishop of the parish of hermopolis and another of an admonitory character to his flock at alexandria among them also be the one write to origen on martyrdom and to the brother at laodicea of whom thelymidres be bishop he likewise sent one on repentance to the brother in armenia of whom merozanes be bishop besides all these he write to cornelius of rome when he have receive from him an epistle against novatus he state in this that he have be invite by helenus bishop of tarsus in cilicia and the others who be with him firmilianus bishop in cappadocia and theoctistus of palestine to meet them at the synod in antioch where some person be endeavor to establish the schism of novatus besides this he writes that he have be inform that fabius have fall asleep and that demetrianus have be appoint his successor in the episcopate of antioch he writes also in these word concern the bishop of jerusalem for the bless alexander have be confine in prison pass away happily in addition to this there be extant also a certain other diaconal epistle of dionysius sent to those in rome through hippolytus and he write another to them on peace and likewise on repentance and yet another to the confessor there who still held to the opinion of novatus he sent two more to the same person after they have return to the church and he communicate with many others by letter which he have left behind him a a benefit in various way to those who now diligently study his writing book vii introduction in this seventh book of the church history the great bishop of alexandria dionysius shall again assist u by his own word relate the several affair of his time in the epistle which he have left i will begin with them chapter the wickedness of decius and gallus when decius have reign not quite two year he be slain with his child and gallus succeed him at this time origen die be sixtynine year of age dionysius write to hermammon speaks a follow of gallus gallus neither recognize the wickedness of decius nor consider what have destroyed him but stumble on the same stone though it lay before his eye for when his reign be prosperous and affair be proceed accord to his mind he attack the holy men who be intercede with god for his peace and welfare therefore with them he persecute also their prayer in his behalf so much concern him chapter the bishop of rome in those time cornelius have held the episcopate in the city of rome about three year be succeed by lucius he die in less than eight month and transmit his office to stephen dionysius write to him the first of his letter on baptism a no small controversy have arisen a to whether those who have turn from any heresy should be purify by baptism for the ancient custom prevail in regard to such that they should receive only the lay on of hand with prayer chapter cyprian and the bishop with him first taught that it be necessary to purify by baptism those convert from heresy first of all cyprian pastor of the parish of carthage maintain that they should not be receive except they have be purify from their error by baptism but stephen consider it unnecessary to add any innovation contrary to the tradition which have be held from the begin be very indignant at this chapter the epistle which dionysius write on this subject dionysius therefore have communicate with him extensively on this question by letter finally show him that since the persecution have abate the church everywhere have reject the novelty of novatus and be at peace among themselves he writes a follow chapter the peace follow the persecution but know now my brother that all the church throughout the east and beyond which formerly be divide have become united and all the bishop everywhere be of one mind and rejoice greatly in the peace which have come beyond expectation thus demetrianus in antioch theoctistus in caesarea mazabanes in aelia marinus in tyre alexander have fall asleep heliodorus in laodicea thelymidres be dead helenus in tarsus and all the church of cilicia firmilianus and all cappadocia i have name only the more illustrious bishop that i may not make my epistle too long and my word too burdensome and all syria and arabia to which you send help when need and whither you have just write mesopotamia pontus bithynia and in short all everywhere be rejoice and glorify god for the unanimity and brotherly love thus far dionysius but stephen have fill his office two year be succeed by xystus dionysius write him a second epistle on baptism in which he show him at the same time the opinion and judgment of stephen and the other bishop and speaks in this manner of stephen he therefore have write previously concern helenus and firmilianus and all those in cilicia and cappadocia and galatia and the neighbor nation say that he would not commune with them for this same cause namely that they rebaptized heretic but consider the importance of the matter for truly in the large synod of the bishop a i learn decree have be pass on this subject that those come over from heresy should be instruct and then should be wash and cleanse from the filth of the old and impure leaven and i write entreat him concern all these thing far on he say i write also at first in few word recently in many to our beloved fellowpresbyters dionysius and philemon who formerly have held the same opinion a stephen and have write to me on the same matter so much in regard to the abovementioned controversy chapter the heresy of sabellius he refers also in the same letter to the heretical teaching of sabellius which be in his time become prominent and say for concern the doctrine now agitate in ptolemais of pentapolis which be impious and marked by great blasphemy against the almighty god the father and our lord jesus christ and contains much unbelief respect his only begotten son and the firstborn of every creature the word which become man and a want of perception of the holy spirit a there come to me communication from both side and brother discuss the matter i write certain letter treat the subject a instructively a by the help of god i be able of these i send thee copy chapter the abominable error of the heretic the divine vision of dianysius and the ecclesiastical canon which he receive in the third epistle on baptism which this same dionysius write to philemon the roman presbyter he relates the follow but i examine the work and tradition of the heretic defile my mind for a little time with their abominable opinion but receive this benefit from them that i refute them by myself and detest them all the more and when a certain brother among the presbyter restrain me fear that i should be carry away with the filth of their wickedness for it would defile my soul in which also a i perceive he spoke the truth a vision sent from god come and strengthen me and the word which come to me command me say distinctly read everything which thou canst take in hand for thou art able to correct and prove all and this have be to thee from the begin the cause of thy faith i receive the vision a agree with the apostolic word which say to them that be strong be skillful moneychangers then after say some thing concern all the heresy he add i receive this rule and ordinance from our bless father heraclas for those who come over from heresy although they have apostatize from the church or rather have not apostatize but seem to meet with them yet be charge with resort to some false teacher when he have expel them from the church he do not receive them back though they entreat for it until they have publicly report all thing which they have heard from their adversary but then he receive them without require of them another baptism for they have formerly receive the holy spirit from him again after treat the question thoroughly he add i have learn also that this be not a novel practice introduce in africa alone but that even long ago in the time of the bishop before u this opinion have be adopt in the most populous church and in synod of the brother in iconium and synnada and by many others to overturn their counsel and throw them into strife and contention i can not endure for it be say thou shalt not remove thy neighbor landmark which thy father have set his fourth epistle on baptism be write to dionysius of rome who be then a presbyter but not long after receive the episcopate of that church it be evident from what be state of him by dionysius of alexandria that he also be a learn and admirable man among other thing he writes to him a follow concern novatus chapter the heterodoxy of navatus for with good reason do we feel hatred toward novatian who have sunder the church and drawn some of the brother into impiety and blasphemy and have introduce impious teach concern god and have calumniate our most compassionate lord jesus christ a unmerciful and besides all this he reject the holy baptism and overturn the faith and confession which precede it and entirely banishes from them the holy ghost if indeed there be any hope that he would remain or return to them chapter the ungodly baptism of the heretic his fifth epistle be write to xystus bishop of rome in this after say much against the heretic he relates a certain occurrence of his time a follow for truly brother i be in need of counsel and i ask thy judgment concern a certain matter which have come to me fear that i may be in error for one of the brother that assemble who have long be consider a believer and who before my ordination and i think before the appointment of the bless heraclas be a member of the congregation be present with those who be recently baptize and when he heard the question and answer he come to me weep and bewailing himself and fall at my foot he acknowledge and protest that the baptism with which he have be baptize among the heretic be not of this character nor in any respect like this because it be full of impiety and blasphemy and he say that his soul be now pierce with sorrow and that he have not confidence to lift his eye to god because he have set out from those impious word and deed and on this account he besought that he might receive this most perfect purification and reception and grace but i do not dare to do this and say that his long communion be sufficient for this for i should not dare to renew from the begin one who have heard the give of thanks and join in repeat the amen who have stood by the table and have stretch forth his hand to receive the bless food and who have receive it and partaken for a long while of the body and blood of our lord jesus christ but i exhort him to be of good courage and to approach the partake of the saint with firm faith and good hope but he do not cease lament and he shudder to approach the table and scarcely though entreat do he dare to be present at the prayer besides these there be also extant another epistle of the same man on baptism address by him and his parish to xystus and the church at rome in this he considers the question then agitate with extend argument and there be extant yet another after these address to dionysius of rome concern lucian so much with reference to these chapter valerian and the persecution under him gallus and the other ruler have held the government less than two year be overthrown and valerian with his son gallienus receive the empire the circumstance which dionysius relates of him we may learn from his epistle to hermammon in which he give the follow account and in like manner it be reveal to john for there be give to him he say a mouth speak great thing and blasphemy and there be give unto him authority and forty and two month it be wonderful that both of these thing occur under valerian and it be the more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct for he have be mild and friendly toward the men of god for none of the emperor before him have treat them so kindly and favorably and not even those who be say openly to be christian receive them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness a he do at the begin of his reign for his entire house be fill with pious person and be a church of god but the teacher and ruler of the synagogue of the magi from egypt persuade him to change his course urge him to slay and persecute pure and holy men because they oppose and hinder the corrupt and abominable incantation for there be and there be men who be present and be see though they only breathe and spoke be able to scatter the counsel of the sinful demon and he induced him to practice initiation and abominable sorcery and to offer unacceptable sacrifice to slay innumerable child and to sacrifice the offspring of unhappy father to divide the bowel of newborn babe and to mutilate and cut to piece the creature of god a if by suck practice they could attain happiness he add to this the follow splendid indeed be the thankofferings which macrianus brought them for the empire which be the object of his hope he be say to have be formerly the emperor general finance minister yet he do nothing praiseworthy or of general benefit but fell under the prophetic say woe unto those who prophesy from their own heart and do not consider the general good for he do not perceive the general providence nor do he look for the judgment of him who be before all and through all and over all wherefore he become an enemy of his catholic church and alienate and estrange himself from the compassion of god and flee a far a possible from his salvation in this he show the truth of his own name and again farther on he say for valerian be instigate to such act by this man be give over to insult and reproach accord to what be say by isaiah they have chosen their own way and their abomination in which their soul delighted i also will choose their delusion and will render unto them their sin but this man madly desire the kingdom though unworthy of it and be unable to put the royal garment on his cripple body set forward his two son to bear their father sin for concern them the declaration which god spoke be plain visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me for heap on the head of his son his own evil desire in which he have met with success he wipe off upon them his own wickedness and hatred toward god dionysius relates these thing concern valerian chapter the event which happen at this time to dionysius and those in egypt but a regard the persecution which prevail so fiercely in his reign and the suffering which dionysius with others endure on account of piety toward the god of the universe his own word shall show which he write in answer to germanus a contemporary bishop who be endeavor to slander him his statement be a follow truly i be in danger of fall into great folly and stupidity through be force to relate the wonderful providence of god toward u but since it be say that it be good to keep close the secret of a king but it be honorable to reveal the work of god i will join issue with the violence of germanus i go not alone to aemilianus but my fellowpresbyter maximus and the deacon faustus eusebius and chaeremon and a brother who be present from rome go with me but aemilianus do not at first say to me hold no assembly for this be superfluous to him and the last thing to one who be seek to accomplish the first for he be not concerned about our assemble but that we ourselves should not be christian and he command me to give this up suppose if i turn from it the others also would follow me but i answer him neither unsuitably nor in many word we must obey god rather than men and i testify openly that i worship the one only god and no other and that i would not turn from this nor would i ever cease to be a christian thereupon he command u to go to a village near the desert call cephro but listen to the very word which be spoken on both side a they be record dionysius faustus maximus marcellus and chaeremon be arraign aemilianus the prefect say i have reason verbally with you concern the clemency which our ruler have show to you for they have give you the opportunity to save yourselves if you will turn to that which be accord to nature and worship the god that preserve their empire and forget those that be contrary to nature what then do you say to this for i do not think that you will be ungrateful for their kindness since they would turn you to a well course dionysius reply not all people worship all god but each one those whom he approves we therefore reverence and worship the one god the maker of all who hath give the empire to the divinely favor and august valerian and gallienus and we pray to him continually for their empire that it may remain unshaken aemilianus the prefect say to them but who forbids you to worship him if he be a god together with those who be god by nature for ye have be command to reverence the god and the god whom all know dionysius answer we worship no other aemilianus the prefect say to them i see that you be at once ungrateful and insensible to the kindness of our sovereign wherefore ye shall not remain in this city but ye shall be sent into the region of libya to a place call cephro for i have chosen this place at the command of our sovereign and it shall by no mean be permit you or any others either to hold assembly or to enter into the socalled cemetery but if any one shall be see without the place which i have command or be found in any assembly he will bring peril on himself for suitable punishment shall not fail go therefore where ye have be order and he hasten me away though i be sick not grant even a day respite what opportunity then do i have either to hold assembly or not to hold them farther on he say but through the help of the lord we do not give up the open assembly but i call together the more diligently those who be in the city a if i be with them be so to speak absent in body but present in spirit but in cephro a large church gather with u of the brother that follow u from the city and those that join u from egypt and there god open unto u a door for the word at first we be persecute and stone but afterwards not a few of the heathen forsook the idol and turn to god for until this time they have not heard the word since it be then first sown by u and a if god have brought u to them for this purpose when we have perform this ministry he transfer u to another place for aemilianus a it appear desire to transport u to rougher and more libyanlike place so he command them to assemble from all quarter in mareotis and assign to them different village throughout the country but he order u to be place nearer the highway that we might be seize first for evidently he arrange and prepared matter so that whenever he wish to seize u he could take all of u without difficulty when i be first order to go to cephro i do not know where the place be and have scarcely ever heard the name yet i go readily and cheerfully but when i be told that i be to remove to the district of colluthion those who be present know how i be affected for here i will accuse myself at first i be grieve and greatly disturbed for though these place be well know and more familiar to u yet the country be say to be destitute of brother and of men of character and to be expose to the annoyance of traveler and incursion of robber but i be comfort when the brother remind me that it be nearer the city and that while cephro afford u much intercourse with the brother from egypt so that we be able to extend the church more widely a this place be nearer the city we should enjoy more frequently the sight of those who be truly beloved and most closely related and dearest to u for they would come and remain and special meeting could be held a in the more remote suburb and thus it turn out after other matter he writes again a follow of the thing which happen to him germanus indeed boast of many confession he can speak forsooth of many adversity which he himself have endure but be he able to reckon up a many a we can of sentence confiscation proscription plunder of good loss of dignity contempt of worldly glory disregard for the flattery of governor and of councilors and patient endurance of the threat of opponent of outcry of peril and persecution and wander and distress and all kind of tribulation such a come upon me under decius and sabinus and such a continue even now under aemilianus but where have germanus be see and what account be there of him but i turn from this great folly into which i be fall on account of germanus and for the same reason i desist from give to the brother who know it an account of everything which take place the same writer also in the epistle to domitius and didymus mention some particular of the persecution a follow a our people be many and unknown to you it would be superfluous to give their name but understand that men and woman young and old maiden and matron soldier and civilian of every race and age some by scourge and fire others by the sword have conquer in the strife and receive their crown but in the case of some a very long time be not sufficient to make them appear acceptable to the lord a indeed it seem also in my own case that sufficient time have not yet elapse wherefore he have retain me for the time which he know to be fitting say in an acceptable time have i heard thee and in a day of salvation have i help thee for a you have inquire of our affair and desire u to tell you how we be situate you have heard fully that when we that be myself and gaius and faustus and peter and paul be lead away a prisoner by a centurion and magistrate with their soldier and servant certain person from mareotis come and drag u away by force a we be unwilling to follow them but now i and gaius and peter be alone deprive of the other brother and shut up in a desert and dry place in libya three day journey from paraetonium he say farther on the presbyter maximus dioscorus demetrius and lucius conceal themselves in the city and visit the brother secretly for faustinus and aquila who be more prominent in the world be wander in egypt but the deacon faustus eusebius and chaeremon have survive those who die in the pestilence eusebius be one whom god have strengthen and endow from the first to fulfill energetically the ministration for the imprison confessor and to attend to the dangerous task of prepare for burial the body of the perfect and bless martyr for a i have say before unto the present time the governor continue to put to death in a cruel manner those who be brought to trial and he destroys some with torture and waste others away with imprisonment and bond and he suffers no one to go near them and investigates whether any one do so nevertheless god give relief to the afflict through the zeal and persistence of the brother thus far dionysius but it should be know that eusebius whom he call a deacon shortly afterward become bishop of the church of laodicea in syria and maximus of whom he speaks a be then a presbyter succeed dionysius himself a bishop of alexandria but the faustus who be with him and who at that time be distinguish for his confession be preserve until the persecution in our day when be very old and full of day he close his life by martyrdom be behead but such be the thing which happen at that time to dionysius chapter the martyr in caesarea in palestine during the abovementioned persecution under valerian three men in caesarea in palestine be conspicuous in their confession of christ be adorn with divine martyrdom become food for wild beast one of them be call priscus another malchus and the name of the third be alexander they say that these men who live in the country act at first in a cowardly manner a if they be careless and thoughtless for when the opportunity be give to those who long for the prize with heavenly desire they treat it lightly l they should seize the crown of martyrdom prematurely but have deliberate on the matter they hasten to caesarea and go before the judge and met the end we have mention they relate that besides these in the same persecution and the same city a certain woman endure a similar conflict but it be report that she belong to the sect of marcion chapter the peace under gallienus shortly after this valerian be reduce to slavery by the barbarian and his son have become sole ruler conduct the government more prudently he immediately restrain the persecution against u by public proclamation and direct the bishop to perform in freedom their customary duty in a rescript which ran a follow the emperor caesar publius licinius gallienus pius felix augustus to dionysius pinna demetrius and the other bishop i have order the bounty of my gift to be declare through all the world that they may depart from the place of religious worship and for this purpose you may use this copy of my rescript that no one may molest you and this which you be now enable lawfully to do have already for a long time be concede by me therefore aurelius cyrenius who be the chief administrator of affair will observe this ordinance which i have give i have give this in a translation from the latin that it may be more readily understood another decree of his be extant address to other bishop permit them to take possession again of the socalled cemetery chapter the bishop that flourish at that time at that time xystus be still preside over the church of rome and demetrianus successor of fabius over the church of antioch and firmilianus over that of caesarea in cappadocia and besides these gregory and his brother athenodorus friend of origen be preside over the church in pontus and theoctistus of caesarea in palestine have die domnus receive the episcopate there he held it but a short time and theotecnus our contemporary succeed him he also be a member of origen school but in jerusalem after the death of mazabanes hymenaeus who have be celebrate among u for a great many year succeed to his seat chapter the martyrdom of marinus at caesarea at this time when the peace of the church have be everywhere restore marinus in caesarea in palestine who be honor for his military deed and illustrious by virtue of family and wealth be behead for his testimony to christ on the follow account the vinebranch be a certain mark of honor among the roman and those who obtain it become they say centurion a place be vacate the order of succession call marinus to this position but when he be about to receive the honor another person come before the tribunal and claimed that it be not legal accord to the ancient law for him to receive the roman dignity a he be a christian and do not sacrifice to the emperor but that the office belong rather to him thereupon the judge whose name be achaeus be disturbed first ask what opinion marinus held and when he perceive that he continually confess himself a christian he give him three hour for reflection when he come out from the tribunal theotecnus the bishop there take him aside and converse with him and take his hand lead him into the church and stand with him within in the sanctuary he raise his cloak a little and point to the sword that hung by his side and at the same time he place before him the scripture of the divine gospel and told him to choose which of the two he wish and without hesitation he reach forth his right hand and take the divine scripture hold fast then say theotecnus to him hold fast to god and strengthen by him mayest thou obtain what thou hast chosen and go in peace immediately on his return the herald cry out call him to the tribunal for the appoint time be already complete and stand before the tribunal and manifest great zeal for the faith immediately a he be he be lead away and finish his course by death chapter story in regard to astyrius astyrius also be commemorate on account of his pious boldness in connection with this affair he be a roman of senatorial rank and in favor with the emperor and well know to all on account of his noble birth and wealth be present at the martyr death he take his body away on his shoulder and array him in a splendid and costly garment prepared him for the grave in a magnificent manner and give him fitting burial the friend of this man that remain to our day relate many other fact concern him chapter the sign at paneas of the great might of our savior among these be also the follow wonder at caesarea philippi which the phoenician call paneas spring be show at the foot of the mountain panius out of which the jordan flow they say that on a certain feast day a victim be thrown in and that through the power of the demon it marvelously disappear and that which happen be a famous wonder to those who be present astyrius be once there when these thing be do and see the multitude astonish at the affair he pity their delusion and look up to heaven he supplicate the god over all through christ that he would rebuke the demon who deceive the people and bring the men delusion to an end and they say that when he have prayed thus immediately the sacrifice float on the surface of the fountain and thus the miracle depart and no wonder be ever afterward perform at the place chapter the statue which the woman with an issue of blood erect since i have mention this city i do not think it proper to omit an account which be worthy of record for posterity for they say that the woman with an issue of blood who a we learn from the sacred gospel receive from our savior deliverance from her affliction come from this place and that her house be show in the city and that remarkable memorial of the kindness of the savior to her remain there for there stand upon an elevate stone by the gate of her house a brazen image of a woman kneel with her hand stretch out a if she be pray opposite this be another upright image of a man make of the same material clothed decently in a double cloak and extend his hand toward the woman at his foot beside the statue itself be a certain strange plant which climb up to the hem of the brazen cloak and be a remedy for all kind of disease they say that this statue be an image of jesus it have remain to our day so that we ourselves also saw it when we be stay in the city nor be it strange that those of the gentile who of old be benefit by our savior should have do such thing since we have learn also that the likeness of his apostle paul and peter and of christ himself be preserve in painting the ancient be accustom a it be likely accord to a habit of the gentile to pay this kind of honor indiscriminately to those regard by them a deliverer chapter the episcopal chair of james the chair of james who first receive the episcopate of the church at jerusalem from the savior himself and the apostle and who a the divine record show be call a brother of christ have be preserve until now the brother who have follow him in succession there exhibit clearly to all the reverence which both those of old time and those of our own day maintain and do maintain for holy men on account of their piety so much a to this matter chapter the festal epistle of dionysius in which he also give a paschal canon dionysius besides his epistle already mention write at that time also his extant festal epistle in which he us word of panegyric respect the passover feast he address one of these to flavius and another to domitius and didymus in which he set forth a canon of eight year maintain that it be not proper to observe the paschal feast until after the vernal equinox besides these he sent another epistle to his fellowpresbyters in alexandria a well a various others to different person while the persecution be still prevail chapter the occurrence at alexandria peace have but just be restore when he return to alexandria but a sedition and war broke out again render it impossible if or him to oversee all the brother separate in different place by the insurrection at the feast of the passover a if he be still an exile from alexandria he address them again by letter and in another festal epistle write later to hierax a bishop in egypt he mention the sedition then prevail in alexandria a follow what wonder be it that it be difficult for me to communicate by letter with those who live far away when it be beyond my power even to reason with myself or to take counsel for my own life truly i need to send letter to those who be a my own bowel dwell in one home and brother of one soul and citizen of the same church but how to send them i can not tell for it would be easy for one to go not only beyond the limit of the province but even from the east to the west than from alexandria to alexandria itself for the very heart of the city be more intricate and impassable than that great and trackless desert which israel traverse for two generation and our smooth and waveless harbor have become like the sea divide and wall up through which israel drove and in whose highway the egyptian be overwhelmed for often from the slaughter there commit they appear like the red sea and the river which flow by the city have sometimes seem drier than the waterless desert and more parch than that in which israel a they pass through it so suffer for thirst that they cry out against moses and the water flow for them from the steep rock through him who alone doeth wonder again it have overflow so greatly a to flood all the surround country and the road and the field threaten to bring back the deluge of water that occur in the day of noah and it flow along pollute always with blood and slaughter and drownings a it become for pharaoh through the agency of moses when he change it into blood and it stank and what other water could purify the water which purifies everything how could the ocean so great and impassable for men if pour into it cleanse this bitter sea or how could the great river which flow out of eden if it pour the four head into which it be divide into the one of geon wash away this pollution or when can the air poison by these noxious exhalation become pure for such vapor arise from the earth and wind from the sea and breeze from the river and mist from the harbor that the dew be a it be discharge from dead body putrefy in all the element around u yet men wonder and can not understand whence these continuous pestilence whence these severe sickness whence these deadly disease of all kind whence this various and vast human destruction why this great city no longer contains a many inhabitant from tender infant to those most advanced in life a it formerly contain of those whom it call hearty old men but the men from forty to seventy year of age be then so much more numerous that their number can not now be fill out even when those from fourteen to eighty year be enrol and register for the public allowance of food and the young in appearance have become a it be of equal age with those who formerly be the old but though they see the race of men thus constantly diminish and waste away and though their complete destruction be increase and advance they do not tremble chapter the pestilence which come upon them after these event a pestilential disease follow the war and at the approach of the feast he write again to the brother describe the suffering consequent upon this calamity to other men the present might not seem to be a suitable time for a festival nor indeed be this or any other time suitable for them neither sorrowful time nor even such a might be thought especially cheerful now indeed everything be tear and every one be mourn and wailing resound daily through the city because of the multitude of the dead and die for a it be write of the firstborn of the egyptian so now there have arisen a great cry for there be not a house where there be not one dead and would that this be all for many terrible thing have happen already first they drove u out and when alone and persecute and put to death by all even then we kept the feast and every place of affliction be to u a place of festival field desert ship inn prison but the perfect martyr kept the most joyous festival of all feast in heaven after these thing war and famine follow which we endure in common with the heathen but we bore alone those thing with which they afflict u and at the same time we experienced also the effect of what they inflict upon and suffer from one another and again we rejoice in the peace of christ which he give to u alone but after both we and they have enjoy a very brief season of rest this pestilence assail u to them more dreadful than any dread and more intolerable than any other calamity and a one of their own writer have say the only thing which prevails over all hope but to u this be not so but no less than the other thing be it an exercise and probation for it do not keep aloof even from u but the heathen it assail more severely farther on he add the most of our brother be unsparing in their exceed love and brotherly kindness they held fast to each other and visit the sick fearlessly and minister to them continually serve them in christ and they die with them most joyfully take the affliction of others and draw the sickness from their neighbor to themselves and willingly receive their pain and many who care for the sick and give strength to others die themselves have transfer to themselves their death and the popular say which always seem a mere expression of courtesy they then make real in action take their departure a the others offscouring truly the best of our brother depart from life in this manner include some presbyter and deacon and those of the people who have the high reputation so that this form of death through the great piety and strong faith it exhibit seem to lack nothing of martyrdom and they take the body of the saint in their open hand and in their bosom and close their eye and their mouth and they bore them away on their shoulder and laid them out and they clung to them and embrace them and they prepared them suitably with washing and garment and after a little they receive like treatment themselves for the survivor be continually follow those who have go before them but with the heathen everything be quite otherwise they desert those who begin to be sick and flee from their dearest friend and they cast them out into the street when they be half dead and left the dead like refuse unburied they shun any participation or fellowship with death which yet with all their precaution it be not easy for them to escape after this epistle when peace have be restore to the city he write another festal letter to the brother in egypt and again several others besides this and there be also a certain one extant on the sabbath and another on exercise moreover he write again an epistle to hermammon and the brother in egypt describe at length the wickedness of decius and his successor and mention the peace under gallienus chapter the reign of gallienus but there be nothing like hearing his own word which be a follow then he have betrayed one of the emperor that precede him and make war on the other perish with his whole family speedily and utterly but gallienus be proclaim and universally acknowledge at once an old emperor and a new be before them and continue after them for accord to the word spoken by the prophet isaiah behold the thing from the begin have come to pas and new thing shall now arise for a a cloud passing over the sun ray and obscure them for a little time hide it and appear in it place but when the cloud have pass by or be dissipate the sun which have risen before appear again so macrianus who put himself forward and approach the exist empire of gallienus be not since he never be but the other be just a he be and his kingdom a if it have cast aside old age and have be purify from the former wickedness now blossom out more vigorously and be see and heard farther and extends in all direction he then indicates the time at which he write this in the follow word it occurs to me again to review the day of the imperial year for i perceive that those most impious men though they have be famous yet in a short time have become nameless but the holier and more godly prince have pass the seventh year be now complete the ninth in which we shall keep the feast chapter nepos and his schism besides all these the two book on the promise be prepared by him the occasion of these be nepos a bishop in egypt who taught that the promise to the holy men in the divine scripture should be understood in a more jewish manner and that there would be a certain millennium of bodily luxury upon this earth a he thought that he could establish his private opinion by the revelation of john he write a book on this subject entitle refutation of allegorists dionysius opposes this in his book on the promise in the first he give his own opinion of the dogma and in the second he treat of the revelation of john and mention nepos at the begin writes of him in this manner but since they bring forward a certain work of nepos on which they rely confidently a if it prove beyond dispute that there will be a reign of christ upon earth i confess that in many other respect i approve and love nepos for his faith and industry and diligence in the scripture and for his extensive psalmody with which many of the brother be still delighted and i hold him in the more reverence because he have go to rest before u but the truth should be love and honor most of all and while we should praise and approve ungrudgingly what be say aright we ought to examine and correct what do not seem to have be write soundly be he present to state his opinion orally mere unwritten discussion persuade and reconcile those who be oppose by question and answer would be sufficient but a some think his work very plausible and a certain teacher regard the law and prophet a of no consequence and do not follow the gospel and treat lightly the apostolic epistle while they make promise a to the teach of this work a if it be some great hidden mystery and do not permit our simpler brother to have any sublime and lofty thought concern the glorious and truly divine appear of our lord and our resurrection from the dead and our be gather together unto him and make like him but on the contrary lead them to hope for small and mortal thing in the kingdom of god and for thing such a exist now since this be the case it be necessary that we should dispute with our brother nepos a if he be present farther on he say when i be in the district of arsinoe where a you know this doctrine have prevail for a long time so that schism and apostasy of entire church have result i call together the presbyter and teacher of the brother in the village such brother a wish be also present and i exhort them to make a public examination of this question accordingly when they brought me this book a if it be a weapon and fortress impregnable sit with them from morning till even for three successive day i endeavor to correct what be write in it and i rejoice over the constancy sincerity docility and intelligence of the brother a we consider in order and with moderation the question and the difficulty and the point of agreement and we abstain from defend in every manner and contentiously the opinion which we have once held unless they appear to be correct nor do we evade objection but we endeavor a far a possible to hold to and confirm the thing which lay before u and if the reason give satisfied u we be not ashamed to change our opinion and agree with others but on the contrary conscientiously and sincerely and with heart laid open before god we accepted whatever be establish by the proof and teaching of the holy scripture and finally the author and mover of this teach who be call coracion in the hearing of all the brother that be present acknowledge and testify to u that he would no longer hold this opinion nor discus it nor mention nor teach it a he be fully convince by the argument against it and some of the other brother express their gratification at the conference and at the spirit of conciliation and harmony which all have manifest chapter the apocalypse of john afterward he speaks in this manner of the apocalypse of john some before u have set aside and reject the book altogether criticize it chapter by chapter and pronounce it without sense or argument and maintain that the title be fraudulent for they say that it be not the work of john nor be it a revelation because it be cover thickly and densely by a veil of obscurity and they affirm that none of the apostle rend none of the saint nor any one in the church be it author but that cerinthus who found the sect which be call after him the cerinthian desire reputable authority for his fiction prefixed the name for the doctrine which he taught be this that the kingdom of christ will be an earthly one and a he be himself devote to the pleasure of the body and altogether sensual in his nature he dream that that kingdom would consist in those thing which he desire namely in the delight of the belly and of sexual passion that be to say in eat and drinking and marry and in festival and sacrifice and the slay of victim under the guise of which he thought he could indulge his appetite with a well grace but i could not venture to reject the book a many brother hold it in high esteem but i suppose that it be beyond my comprehension and that there be a certain conceal and more wonderful meaning in every part for if i do not understand i suspect that a deeper sense lie beneath the word i do not measure and judge them by my own reason but leave the more to faith regard them a too high for me to grasp and i do not reject what i can not comprehend but rather wonder because i do not understand it after this he examines the entire book of revelation and have prove that it be impossible to understand it accord to the literal sense proceeds a follow have finish all the prophecy so to speak the prophet pronounces those bless who shall observe it and also himself for he say bless be he that keepeth the word of the prophecy of this book and i john who saw and heard these thing therefore that he be call john and that this book be the work of one john i do not deny and i agree also that it be the work of a holy and inspire man but i can not readily admit that he be the apostle the son of zebedee the brother of james by whom the gospel of john and the catholic epistle be write for i judge from the character of both and the form of expression and the entire execution of the book that it be not his for the evangelist nowhere give his name or proclaims himself either in the gospel or epistle farther on he add but john never speaks a if refer to himself or a if refer to another person but the author of the apocalypse introduces himself at the very begin the revelation of jesus christ which he give him to show unto his servant quickly and he sent and signify it by his angel unto his servant john who bare witness of the word of god and of his testimony even of all thing that he saw then he writes also an epistle john to the seven church which be in asia grace be with you and peace but the evangelist do not prefix his name even to the catholic epistle but without introduction he begin with the mystery of the divine revelation itself that which be from the begin which we have heard which we have see with our eye for because of such a revelation the lord also bless peter say bless art thou simon barjonah for flesh and blood hath not reveal it unto thee but my heavenly father but neither in the repute second or third epistle of john though they be very short do the name john appear but there be write the anonymous phrase the eider but this author do not consider it sufficient to give his name once and to proceed with his work but he take it up again i john who also be your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and in the patience of jesus christ be in the isle that be call patmos for the word of god and the testimony of jesus and toward the close he speaks thus bless be he that keepeth the word of the prophecy of this book and i john who saw and heard these thing but that he who write these thing be call john must be believe a he say it but who he be do not appear for he do not say a often in the gospel that he be the beloved disciple of the lord or the one who lay on his breast or the brother of james or the eyewitness and hearer of the lord for he would have spoken of these thing if he have wish to show himself plainly but he say none of them but speaks of himself a our brother and companion and a witness of jesus and bless because he have see and heard the revelation but i be of the opinion that there be many with the same name a the apostle john who on account of their love for him and because they admire and emulate him and desire to be love by the lord a he be take to themselves the same surname a many of the child of the faithful be call paul or peter for example there be also another john surnamed mark mention in the act of the apostle whom barnabas and paul take with them of whom also it be say and they have also john a their attendant but that it be he who write this i would not say for it not write that he go with them into asia but now when paul and his company set sail from paphos they come to perga in pamphylia and john depart from them return to jerusalem but i think that he be some other one of those in asia a they say that there be two monument in ephesus each bearing the name of john and from the idea and from the word and their arrangement it may be reasonably conjecture that this one be different from that one for the gospel and epistle agree with each other and begin in the same manner the one say in the begin be the word the other that which be from the begin the one and the word be make flesh and dwelt among u and we beheld his glory the glory a of the only begotten of the father the other say the same thing slightly alter which we have heard which we have see with our eye which we have look upon and our hand have handle of the word of life and the life be manifest for he introduces these thing at the begin maintain them a be evident from what follow in opposition to those who say that the lord have not come in the flesh wherefore also he carefully add and we have see and bear witness and declare unto you the eternal life which be with the father and be manifest unto u that which we have see and heard declare we unto you also he hold to this and do not digress from his subject but discus everything under the same head and name some of which we will briefly mention any one who examines carefully will find the phrase the life the light turn from darkness frequently occur in both also continually truth grace joy the flesh and blood of the lord the judgment the forgiveness of sin the love of god toward u the commandment that we love one another that we should keep all the commandment the conviction of the world of the devil of antichrist the promise of the holy spirit the adoption of god the faith continually require of u the father and the son occur everywhere in fact it be plainly to be see that one and the same character mark the gospel and the epistle throughout but the apocalypse be different from these writing and foreign to them not touch nor in the least bordering upon them almost so to speak without even a syllable in common with them nay more the epistle for i pas by the gospel do not mention nor do it contain any intimation of the apocalypse nor do the apocalypse of the epistle but paul in his epistle give some indication of his revelation though he have not write them out by themselves moreover it can also be show that the diction of the gospel and epistle differs from that of the apocalypse for they be write not only without error a regard the greek language but also with elegance in their expression in their reasoning and in their entire structure they be far indeed from betraying any barbarism or solecism or any vulgarism whatever for the writer have a it seem both the requisite of discourse that be the gift of knowledge and the gift of expression a the lord have bestow them both upon him i do not deny that the other writer saw a revelation and receive knowledge and prophecy i perceive however that his dialect and language be not accurate greek but that he us barbarous idiom and in some place solecism it be unnecessary to point these out here for i would not have any one think that i have say these thing in a spirit of ridicule for i have say what i have only with the purpose of show dearly the difference between the writing chapter the epistle of dionysius besides these many other epistle of dionysius be extant a those against sabellius address to ammon bishop of the church of bernice and one to telesphorus and one to euphranor and again another to ammon and euporus he write also four other book on the same subject which he address to his namesake dionysius in rome besides these many of his epistle be with u and large book write in epistolary form a those on nature address to the young man timothy and one on temptation which he also dedicate to euphranor moreover in a letter to basilides bishop of the parish in pentapolis he say that he have write an exposition of the begin of ecclesiastes and he have left u also various letter address to this same person thus much dionysius but our account of these matter be now complete permit u to show to posterity the character of our own age chapter paul of samosata and the heresy introduce by him at antioch after xystus have preside over the church of rome for eleven year dionysius namesake of him of alexandria succeed him about the same time demetrianus die in antioch and paul of samosata receive that episcopate a he held contrary to the teach of the church low and degrade view of christ namely that in his nature he be a common man dionysius of alexandria be entreat to come to the synod but be unable to come on account of age and physical weakness he give his opinion on the subject under consideration by letter but all the other pastor of the church from all direction make haste to assemble at antioch a against a despoiler of the flock of christ chapter the illustrious bishop of that time of these the most eminent be firmilianus bishop of caesarea in cappadocia the brother gregory and athenodorus pastor of the church in pontus helenus of the parish of tarsus and nicomas of iconium moreover hymenaeus of the church of jerusalem and theotecnus of the neighbor church of caesarea and besides these maximus who preside in a distinguish manner over the brother in bostra if any should count them up he could not fail to note a great many others besides presbyter and deacon who be at that time assemble for the same cause in the abovementioned city but these be the most illustrious when all of these assemble at different time and frequently to consider these matter the argument and question be discuss at every meeting the adherent of the samosatian endeavor to cover and conceal his heterodoxy and the others strive zealously to lay bare and make manifest his heresy and blasphemy against christ meanwhile dionysius die in the twelfth year of the reign of gallienus have held the episcopate of alexandria for seventeen year and maximus succeed him gallienus after a reign of fifteen year n be succeed by claudius who in two year deliver the government to aurelian chapter paul have be refute by malchion a presbyter from the sophist be excommunicate during his reign a final synod compose of a great many bishop be held and the leader of heresy in antioch be detect and his false doctrine clearly show before all and he be excommunicate from the catholic church under heaven malchion especially drew him out of his hidingplace and refute him he be a man learn in other respect and principal of the sophist school of grecian learn in antioch yet on account of the superior nobility of his faith in christ he have be make a presbyter of that parish this man have conduct a discussion with him which be take down by stenographer and which we know be still extant be alone able to detect the man who dissemble and deceive the others chapter the epistle of the bishop against paul the pastor who have assemble about this matter prepared by common consent an epistle address to dionysius bishop of rome and maximus of alexandria and sent it to all the province in this they make manifest to all their own zeal and the perverse error of paul and the argument and discussion which they have with him and show the entire life and conduct of the man it may be well to put on record at the present time the follow extract from their write to dionysius and maximus and to all our fellowministers throughout the world bishop presbyter and deacon and to the whole catholic church under heaven helenus hymenaeus theophilus theotecnus maximus proclus nicomas aelianus paul bolanus protogenes hierax eutychius theodorus malchion and lucius and all the others who dwell with u in the neighbor city and nation bishop presbyter and deacon and the church of god greet to the beloved brother in the lord a little farther on they proceed thus we sent for and call many of the bishop from a distance to relieve u from this deadly doctrine a dionysius of alexandria and firmilianus of cappadocia those bless men the first of these not consider the author of this delusion worthy to be address sent a letter to antioch not write to him but to the entire parish of which we give a copy below but firmilianus come twice and condemn his innovation a we who be present know and testify and many others understand but a he promise to change his opinion he believe him and hop that without any reproach to the word what be necessary would be do so he delayed the matter be deceive by him who deny even his own god and lord and have not kept the faith which he formerly held and now firmilianus be again on his way to antioch and have come a far a tarsus because he have learn by experience his goddenying wickedness but while we have come together be call for him and await his arrival he die after other thing they describe a follow the manner of life which he lead whereas he have depart from the rule of faith and have turn aside after base and spurious teaching it be not necessary since he be without that we should pas judgment upon his practice a for instance in that although formerly destitute and poor and have receive no wealth from his father nor make anything by trade or business he now posse abundant wealth through his iniquity and sacrilegious act and through those thing which he extorts from the brother deprive the injured of their right and promising to assist them for reward yet deceive them and plunder those who in their trouble be ready to give that they may obtain reconciliation with their oppressor suppose that gain be godliness or in that he be haughty and be puffed up and assumes worldly dignity prefer to be call ducenarius rather than bishop and strut in the marketplace reading letter and recite them a he walk in public attend by a bodyguard with a multitude precede and follow him so that the faith be envy and hat on account of his pride and haughtiness of heart or in that he practice chicanery in ecclesiastical assembly contrives to glorify himself and deceive with appearance and astonish the mind of the simple prepare for himself a tribunal and lofty throne not like a disciple of christ and possess a secretum like the ruler of the world and so call it and strike his thigh with his hand and stamp on the tribunal with his foot or in that he rebuke and insult those who do not applaud and shake their handkerchief a in the theater and shout and leap about like the men and woman that be station around him and hear him in this unbecoming manner but who listen reverently and orderly a in the house of god or in that he violently and coarsely assails in public the expounder of the word that have depart this life and magnifies himself not a a bishop but a a sophist and juggler and stop the psalm to our lord jesus christ a be the modern production of modern men and train woman to sing psalm to himself in the midst of the church on the great day of the passover which any one might shudder to hear and persuades the bishop and presbyter of the neighbor district and city who fawn upon him to advance the same idea in their discourse to the people for to anticipate something of what we shall presently write he be unwilling to acknowledge that the son of god have come down from heaven and this be not a mere assertion but it be abundantly prove from the record which we have sent you and not least where he say jesus christ be from below but those sing to him and extol him among the people say that their impious teacher have come down an angel from heaven and he do not forbid such thing but the arrogant man be even present when they be uttered and there be the woman the subintroductae a the people of antioch call them belonging to him and to the presbyter and deacon that be with him although he know and have convict these men yet he connives at this and their other incurable sin in order that they may be bound to him and through fear for themselves may not dare to accuse him for his wicked word and deed but he have also make them rich on which account he be love and admire by those who covet such thing we know beloved that the bishop and all the clergy should be an example to the people of all good work and we be not ignorant how many have fall or incur suspicion through the woman whom they have thus brought in so that even if we should allow that he commits no sinful act yet he ought to avoid the suspicion which arises from such a thing l he scandalize some one or lead others to imitate him for how can he reprove or admonish another not to be too familiar with woman l he fall a it be write when he have himself sent one away already and now have two with him blooming and beautiful and take them with him wherever he go and at the same time life in luxury and surfeit because of these thing all mourn and lament by themselves but they so fear his tyranny and power that they dare not accuse him but a we have say while one might call the man to account for this conduct if he held the catholic doctrine and be numbered with u since he have scorn the mystery and strut about in the abominable heresy of artemas for why should we not mention his father we think it unnecessary to demand of him an explanation of these thing afterwards at the close of the epistle they add these word therefore we have be compel to excommunicate him since he set himself against god and refuse to obey and to appoint in his place another bishop for the catholic church by divine direction a we believe we have appoint domnus who be adorn with all the quality become in a bishop and who be a son of the bless demetrianus who formerly preside in a distinguish manner over the same parish we have inform you of this that you may write to him and may receive letter of communion from him but let this man write to artemas and let those who think a artemas do communicate with him a paul have fall from the episcopate a well a from the orthodox faith domnus a have be say become bishop of the church at antioch but a paul refuse to surrender the church building the emperor aurelian be petition and he decide the matter most equitably order the building to be give to those to whom the bishop of italy and of the city of rome should adjudge it thus this man be driven out of the church with extreme disgrace by the worldly power such be aurelians treatment of u at that time but in the course of his reign he change his mind in regard to u and be move by certain adviser to institute a persecution against u and there be great talk about this on every side but a he be about to do it and be so to speak in the very act of signing the decree against u the divine judgment come upon him and restrain him at the very verge of his undertaking show in a manner that all could see clearly that the ruler of this world can never find an opportunity against the church of christ except the hand that defends them permit it in divine and heavenly judgment for the sake of discipline and correction at such time a it see best after a reign of six year aurelian be succeed by probus he reign for the same number of year and carus with his son carinus and numerianus succeed him after they have reign less than three year the government devolve on diocletian and those associate with him under them take place the persecution of our time and the destruction of the church connect with it shortly before this dionysius bishop of rome after hold office for nine year die and be succeed by felix chapter the perversive heresy of the manichean which begin at this time at this time the madman name from his demoniacal heresy arm himself in the perversion of his reason a the devil satan who himself fight against god put him forward to the destruction of many he be a barbarian in life both in word and deed and in his nature demoniacal and insane in consequence of this he sought to pose a christ and be puffed up in his madness he proclaim himself the paraclete and the very holy spirit and afterwards like christ he chose twelve disciple a partner of his new doctrine and he patch together false and godless doctrine collect from a multitude of longextinct impiety and swept them like a deadly poison from persia to our part of the world from him the impious name of the manichean be still prevalent among many such be the foundation of this knowledge falsely socalled which sprang up in those time chapter the distinguish ecclesiastic of our day and which of them survive until the destruction of the church at this time felix have preside over the church of rome for five year be succeed by eutychianus but he in less than ten month left the position to caius who live in our day he held it about fifteen year and be in turn succeed by marcellinus who be overtaken by the persecution about the same time timaeus receive the episcopate of antioch after domnus and cyril who live in our day succeed him in his time we become acquaint with dorotheus a man of learn among those of his day who be honor with the office of presbyter in antioch he be a lover of the beautiful in divine thing and devote himself to the hebrew language so that he read the hebrew scripture with facility he belong to those who be especially liberal and be not unacquainted with grecian propaedeutic besides this he be a eunuch have be so from his very birth on this account a if it be a miracle the emperor take him into his family and honor him by place him over the purple dyeworks at tyre we have heard him expound the scripture wisely in the church after cyril tyrannus receive the episcopate of the parish of antioch in his time occur the destruction of the church eusebius who have come from the city of alexandria rule the parish of laodicea after socrates the occasion of his removal thither be the affair of paul he go on this account to syria and be restrain from return home by those there who be zealous in divine thing among our contemporary he be a beautiful example of religion a be readily see from the word of dionysius which we have quote anatolius be appoint his successor one good man a they say follow another he also be an alexandrian by birth in learn and skill in greek philosophy such a arithmetic and geometry astronomy and dialectic in general a well a in the theory of physic he stood first among the ablest men of our time and he be also at the head in rhetorical science it be report that for this reason he be request by the citizen of alexandria to establish there a school of aristotelian philosophy they relate of him many other eminent deed during the siege of the pyrucheium in alexandria on account of which he be especially honor by all those in high office but i will give the follow only a an example they say that bread have fail the besiege so that it be more difficult to withstand the famine than the enemy outside but he be present provide for them in this manner a the other part of the city be allied with the roman army and therefore be not under siege anatolius sent for eusebius for he be still there before his transfer to syria and be among those who be not besiege and possess moreover a great reputation and a renowned name which have reach even the roman general and he inform him of those who be perish in the siege from famine when he learn this he request the roman commander a the great possible favor to grant safety to deserter from the enemy have obtain his request he communicate it to anatolius a soon a he receive the message he convene the senate of alexandria and at first propose that all should come to a reconciliation with the roman but when he perceive that they be angered by this advice he say but i do not think you will oppose me if i counsel you to send the supernumerary and those who be in nowise useful to u a old woman and child and old men outside the gate to go wherever they may please for why should we retain for no purpose these who must at any rate soon die and why should we destroy with hunger those who be cripple and maim in body when we ought to provide only for men and youth and to distribute the necessary bread among those who be need for the garrison of the city with such argument he persuade the assembly and rise first he give his vote that the entire multitude whether of men or woman who be not needful for the army should depart from the city because if they remain and unnecessarily continued in the city there would be for them no hope of safety but they would perish with famine a all the others in the senate agree to this he save almost all the besiege he provide that first those belonging to the church and afterwards of the others in the city those of every age should escape not only the class include in the decree but under cover of these a multitude of others secretly clothed in woman garment and through his management they go out of the gate by night and escape to the roman camp there eusebius like a father and physician receive all of them waste away through the long siege and restore them by every kind of prudence and care the church of laodicea be honor by two such pastor in succession who in the providence of god come after the aforesaid war from alexandria to that city anatolius do not write very many work but in such a have come down to u we can discern his eloquence and erudition in these he state particularly his opinion on the passover it seem important to give here the follow extract from them from the paschal canon of anatolius there be then in the first year the new moon of the first month which be the begin of every cycle of nineteen year on the twentysixth day of the egyptian phamenoth but accord to the month of the macedonian the twentysecond day of dystrus or a the roman would say the eleventh before the kalends of april on the say twentysixth of phamenoth the sun be found not only enter on the first segment but already passing through the fourth day in it they be accustom to call this segment the first dodecatomorion and the equinox and the begin of month and the head of the cycle and the startingpoint of the planetary circuit but they call the one precede this the last of month and the twelfth segment and the final dodecatomorion and the end of the planetary circuit wherefore we maintain that those who place the first month in it and determine by it the fourteenth of the passover commit no slight or common blunder and this be not an opinion of our own but it be know to the jew of old even before christ and be carefully observe by them this may be learn from what be say by philo josephus and musaeus and not only by them but also by those yet more ancient the two agathobuli surnamed master and the famous aristobulus who be chosen among the seventy interpreter of the sacred and divine hebrew scripture by ptolemy philadelphus and his father and who also dedicate his exegetical book on the law of moses to the same king these writer explain question in regard to the exodus say that all alike should sacrifice the passover offering after the vernal equinox in the middle of the first month but this occurs while the sun be passing through the first segment of the solar or a some of them have style it the zodiacal circle aristobulus add that it be necessary for the feast of the passover that not only the sun should pas through the equinoctial segment but the moon also for a there be two equinoctial segment the vernal and the autumnal directly opposite each other and a the day of the passover be appoint on the fourteenth of the month begin with the even the moon will hold a position diametrically opposite the sun a may be see in full moon and the sun will be in the segment of the vernal equinox and of necessity the moon in that of the autumnal i know that many other thing have be say by them some of them probable and some approach absolute demonstration by which they endeavor to prove that it be altogether necessary to keep the passover and the feast of unleavened bread after the equinox but i refrain from demand this sort of demonstration for matter from which the veil of the mosaic law have be remove so that now at length with uncovered face we continually behold a in a glass christ and the teaching and suffering of christ but that with the hebrew the first month be near the equinox the teaching also of the book of enoch show the same writer have also left the institute of arithmetic in ten book and other evidence of his experience and proficiency in divine thing theotecnus bishop of caesarea in palestine first ordain him a bishop design to make him his successor in his own parish after his death and for a short time both of them preside over the same church but the synod which be held to consider paul case call him to antioch and a he pass through the city of laodicea eusebius be dead he be detain by the brother there and after anatolius have depart this life the last bishop of that parish before the persecution be stephen who be admire by many for his knowledge of philosophy and other greek learn but he be not equally devote to the divine faith a the progress of the persecution manifest for it show that he be a cowardly and unmanly dissembler rather than a true philosopher but this do not seriously injure the church for theodotus restore their affair be straightway make bishop of that parish by god himself the savior of all he justified by his deed both his lordly name and his office of bishop for he excel in the medical art for body and in the heal art for soul nor do any other man equal him in kindness sincerity sympathy and zeal in help such a need his aid he be also greatly devote to divine learn such an one be he in caesarea in palestine agapius succeed theotecnus who have most zealously perform the duty of his episcopate him too we know to have labor diligently and to have manifest most genuine providence in his oversight of the people particularly care for all the poor with liberal hand in his time we become acquaint with pamphilus that most eloquent man of truly philosophical life who be esteem worthy of the office of presbyter in that parish it would be no small matter to show what sort of a man he be and whence he come but we have described in our special work concern him all the particular of his life and of the school which he establish and the trial which he endure in many confession during the persecution and the crown of martyrdom with which he be finally honor but of all that be there he be indeed the most admirable among those near our time we have know pierius of the presbyter in alexandria and meletius bishop of the church in pontus rarest of men the first be distinguish for his life of extreme poverty and his philosophic learn and be exceedingly diligent in the contemplation and exposition of divine thing and in public discourse in the church meletius whom the learn call the honey of attica be a man whom every one would describe a most accomplish in all kind of learn and it would be impossible to admire sufficiently his rhetorical skill it might be say that he possess this by nature but who could surpass the excellence of his great experience and erudition in other respect for in all branch of knowledge have you undertaken to try him even once you would have say that he be the most skillful and learn moreover the virtue of his life be not less remarkable we observe him well in the time of the persecution when for seven full year he be escape from it fury in the region of palestine zambdas receive the episcopate of the church of jerusalem after the bishop hymenaeus whom we mention a little above he die in a short time and hermon the last before the persecution in our day succeed to the apostolic chair which have be preserve there until the present time in alexandria maximus who after the death of dionysius have be bishop for eighteen year be succeed by theonas in his time achillas who have be appoint a presbyter in alexandria at the same time with pierius become celebrate he be place over the school of the sacred faith and exhibit fruit of philosophy most rare and inferior to none and conduct genuinely evangelical after theonas have held the office for nineteen year peter receive the episcopate in alexandria and be very eminent among them for twelve entire year of these he govern the church less than three year before the persecution and for the remainder of his life he subject himself to a more rigid discipline and care in no secret manner for the general interest of the church on this account he be behead in the ninth year of the persecution and be adorn with the crown of martyrdom have write out in these book the account of the succession from the birth of our savior to the destruction of the place of worship a period of three hundred and five year permit me to pas on to the contest of those who in our day have heroically fought for religion and to leave in write for the information of posterity the extent and the magnitude of those conflict book viii introduction a we have described in seven book the event from the time of the apostle we think it proper in this eighth book to record for the information of posterity a few of the most important occurrence of our own time which be worthy of permanent record our account will begin at this point chapter the event which precede the persecution in our time it be beyond our ability to describe in a suitable manner the extent and nature of the glory and freedom with which the word of piety toward the god of the universe proclaim to the world through christ be honor among all men both greek and barbarian before the persecution in our day the favor show our people by the ruler might be adduce a evidence a they commit to them the government of province and on account of the great friendship which they entertain toward their doctrine release them from anxiety in regard to sacrifice why need i speak of those in the royal palace and of the ruler over all who allow the member of their household wife and child and servant to speak openly before them for the divine word and life and suffer them almost to boast of the freedom of their faith indeed they esteem them highly and prefer them to their fellowservants such an one be that dorotheus the most devote and faithful to them of all and on this account especially honor by them among those who held the most honorable office and government with him be the celebrate gorgonius and a many a have be esteem worthy of the same distinction on account of the word of god and one could see the ruler in every church accord the great favor by all officer and governor but how can any one describe those vast assembly and the multitude that crowd together in every city and the famous gathering in the house of prayer on whose account not be satisfied with the ancient building they erect from the foundation large church in all the city no envy hinder the progress of these affair which advanced gradually and grow and increase day by day nor could any evil demon slander them or hinder them through human counsel so long a the divine and heavenly hand watch over and guard his own people a worthy but when on account of the abundant freedom we fell into laxity and sloth and envy and revile each other and be almost a it be take up arm against one another ruler assail ruler with word like spear and people form party against people and monstrous hypocrisy and dissimulation rise to the great height of wickedness the divine judgment with forbearance a be it pleasure while the multitude yet continued to assemble gently and moderately harass the episcopacy this persecution begin with the brother in the army but a if without sensibility we be not eager to make the deity favorable and propitious and some like atheist thought that our affair be unheeded and ungoverned and thus we add one wickedness to another and those esteem our shepherd cast aside the bond of piety be excite to conflict with one another and do nothing else than heap up strife and threat and jealousy and enmity and hatred toward each other like tyrant eagerly endeavor to assert their power then truly accord to the word of jeremiah the lord in his wrath darken the daughter of zion and cast down the glory of israel from heaven to earth and remember not his footstool in the day of his anger the lord also overwhelmed all the beautiful thing of israel and threw down all his stronghold and accord to what be foretold in the psalm he have make void the covenant of his servant and profane his sanctuary to the earth in the destruction of the church and have thrown down all his stronghold and have make his fortress cowardice all that pas by have plunder the multitude of the people and he have become besides a reproach to his neighbor for he have exalt the right hand of his enemy and have turn back the help of his sword and have not take his part in the war but he have deprive him of purification and have cast his throne to the ground he have shorten the day of his time and besides all have pour out shame upon him chapter the destruction of the church all these thing be fulfil in u when we saw with our own eye the house of prayer thrown down to the very foundation and the divine and sacred scripture commit to the flame in the midst of the marketplace and the shepherd of the church basely hidden here and there and some of them capture ignominiously and mocked by their enemy when also accord to another prophetic word contempt be pour out upon ruler and he cause them to wander in an untrodden and pathless way but it be not our place to describe the sad misfortune which finally come upon them a we do not think it proper moreover to record their division and unnatural conduct to each other before the persecution wherefore we have decide to relate nothing concern them except the thing in which we can vindicate the divine judgment hence we shall not mention those who be shaken by the persecution nor those who in everything pertain to salvation be shipwreck and by their own will be sunk in the depth of the flood but we shall introduce into this history in general only those event which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity let u therefore proceed to describe briefly the sacred conflict of the witness of the divine word it be in the nineteenth year of the reign of diocletian in the month dystrus call march by the roman when the feast of the savior passion be near at hand that royal edict be publish everywhere command that the church be level to the ground and the scripture be destroyed by fire and order that those who held place of honor be degrade and that the household servant if they persist in the profession of christianity be deprive of freedom such be the first edict against u but not long after other decree be issue command that all the ruler of the church in every place be first thrown into prison and afterwards by every artifice be compel to sacrifice chapter the nature of the conflict endure in the persecution then truly a great many ruler of the church eagerly endure terrible suffering and furnish example of noble conflict but a multitude of others benumbed in spirit by fear be easily weaken at the first onset of the rest each one endure different form of torture the body of one be scourge with rod another be punish with insupportable rackings and scraping in which some suffer a miserable death others pass through different conflict thus one while those around press him on by force and drag him to the abominable and impure sacrifice be dismiss a if he have sacrifice though he have not another though he have not approach at all nor touch any pollute thing when others say that he have sacrifice go away bearing the accusation in silence another be take up half dead be cast aside a if already dead and again a certain one lie upon the ground be drag a long distance by his foot and count among those who have sacrifice one cry out and with a loud voice testify his rejection of the sacrifice another shout that he be a christian be resplendent in the confession of the save name another protest that he have not sacrifice and never would but they be struck in the mouth and silence by a large band of soldier who be drawn up for this purpose and they be smitten on the face and cheek and driven away by force so important do the enemy of piety regard it by any mean to seem to have accomplish their purpose but these thing do not avail them against the holy martyr for an accurate description of whom what word of ours could suffice chapter the famous martyr of god who fill every place with their memory and won various crown in behalf of religion for we might tell of many who show admirable zeal for the religion of the god of the universe not only from the begin of the general persecution but long before that time while yet peace prevail for though he who have receive power be seemingly arouse now a from a deep sleep yet from the time after decius and valerian he have be plot secretly and without notice against the church he do not wage war against all of u at once but make trial at first only of those in the army for he suppose that the others could be take easily if he should first attack and subdue these thereupon many of the soldier be see most cheerfully embrace private life so that they might not deny their piety toward the creator of the universe for when the commander whoever he be begin to persecute the soldier separate onto tribe an purge those who be enrol in the army give them the choice either by obey to receive the honor which belong to them or on the other hand to be deprive of it if they disobeyed the command a great many soldier of christ kingdom without hesitation instantly prefer the confession of him to the seem glory and prosperity which they be enjoy and one and another of them occasionally receive in exchange for their pious constancy not only the loss of position but death but a yet the instigator of this plot proceed with moderation and venture so far a blood only in some instance for the multitude of believer a it be likely make him afraid and deter him from wag war at once against all but when he make the attack more boldly it be impossible to relate how many and what sort of martyr of god could be see among the inhabitant of all the city and country chapter those in nicomedia immediately on the publication of the decree against the church in nicomedia a certain man not obscure but very highly honor with distinguish temporal dignity move with zeal toward god and incite with ardent faith seize the edict a it be post openly and publicly and tore it to piece a a profane and impious thing and this be do while two of the sovereign be in the same city the old of all and the one who held the fourth place in the government after him but this man first in that place after distinguish himself in such a manner suffer those thing which be likely to follow such dare and kept his spirit cheerful and undisturbed till death chapter those in the palace this period produce divine and illustrious martyr above all whose praise have ever be sung and who have be celebrate for courage whether among greek or barbarian in the person of dorotheus and the servant that be with him in the palace although they receive the high honor from their master and be treat by them a their own child they esteem reproach and trial for religion and the many form of death that be invent against them a in truth great rich than the glory and luxury of this life we will describe the manner in which one of them end his life and leave our reader to infer from his case the suffering of the others a certain man be brought forward in the abovementioned city before the ruler of whom we have spoken he be then command to sacrifice but a he refuse he be order to be strip and raise on high and beaten with rod over his entire body until be conquer he should even against his will do what be command but a he be unmoved by these suffering and his bone be already appear they mixed vinegar with salt and pour it upon the mangle part of his body a he scorn these agony a gridiron and fire be brought forward and the remnant of his body like flesh intend for eat be place on the fire not at once l he should expire instantly but a little at a time and those who place him on the pyre be not permit to desist until after such suffering he should assent to the thing command but he held his purpose firmly and victoriously give up his life while the torture be still go on such be the martyrdom of one of the servant of the palace who be indeed well worthy of his name for he be call peter the martyrdom of the rest though they be not inferior to his we will pas by for the sake of brevity record only that dorotheus and gorgonius with many others of the royal household after varied suffering end their life by strangle and bore away the trophy of godgiven victory at this time anthimus who then prosided over the church in nicomedia be behead for his testimony to christ a great multitude of martyr be add to him a conflagration have broken out in those very day in the palace at nicomedia i know not how which through a false suspicion be laid to our people entire family of the pious in that place be put to death in mass at the royal command some by the sword and others by fire it be report that with a certain divine and indescribable eagerness men and woman rush into the fire and the executioner bound a large number of others and put them on boat and threw them into the depth of the sea and those who have be esteem their master consider it necessary to dig up the body of the imperial servant who have be commit to the earth with suitable burial and cast them into the sea l any a they thought regard them a god might worship them lie in their sepulcher such thing occur in nicomedia at the begin of the persecution but not long after a person in the country call melitene and others throughout syria attempt to usurp the government a royal edict direct that the ruler of the church everywhere should lye thrown into prison and bond what be to be see after this exceeds all description a vast multitude be imprison in every place and the prison everywhere which have long before be prepared for murderer and robber of graf be fill with bishop presbyter and deacon reader and exorcist so that room be no longer left in them for those condemn for crime and a other decree follow the first direct that those in prison if they would sacrifice should be permit to depart in freedom but that those who refuse should be harass with many torture how could any one again number the multitude of martyr in every province and especially of those in africa and mauritania and thebais and egypt from this last country many go into other city and province and become illustrious through martyrdom chapter the egyptian in phoenicia those of them that be conspicuous in palestine we know a also those that be at tyre in phoenicia who that saw them be not astonish at the numberless stripe and at the firmness which these truly wonderful athlete of religion exhibit under them and at their contest immediately after the scourge with bloodthirsty wild beast a they be cast before leopard and different kind of bear and wild boar and bull goad with fire and redhot iron and at the marvelous endurance of these noble men in the face of all sort of wild beast we be present ourselves when these thing occur and have put on record the divine power of our martyr savior jesus christ which be present and manifest itself mightily in the martyr for a long time the mandevouring beast do not dare to touch or draw near the body of those dear to god but rush upon the others who from the outside irritated and urge them on and they would not in the least touch the holy athlete a they stood alone and naked and shook their hand at them to draw them toward themselves for they be command to do this but whenever they rush at them they be restrain a if by some diviner power and retreat again this continued for a long time and occasion no little wonder to the spectator and a the first wild beast do nothing a second and a third be let loose against one and the same martyr one could not but be astonish at the invincible firmness of these holy men and the endure and immovable constancy of those whose body be young you could have see a youth not twenty year of age stand unbound and stretch out his hand in the form of a cross with unterrified and untrembling mind engage earnestly in prayer to god and not in the least go back or retreat from the place where he stood while bear and leopard breathing rage and death almost touch his flesh and yet their mouth be restrain i know not how by a divine and incomprehensible power and they ran back again to their place such an one be he again you might have see others for they be five in all cast before a wild bull who toss into the air with his horn those who approach from the outside and mangle them leave them to be token up half dead but when he rush with rage and threaten upon the holy martyr who be stand alone he be unable to come near them but though he stamp with his foot and push in all direction with his horn and breathe rage and threaten on account of the irritation of the burning iron he be nevertheless held back by the sacred providence and a he in nowise harm them they let loose other wild beast upon them finally after these terrible and various attack upon them they be all slain with the sword and instead of be bury in the earth they be commit to the wave of the sea chapter these in egypt such be the conflict of those egyptian who contend nobly for religion in tyre but we must admire those also who suffer martyrdom in their native land where thousand of men woman and child despise the present life for the sake of the teach of our savior endure various death some of them after scraping and rackings and severest scourgings and numberless other kind of torture terrible even to hear of be commit to the flame some be drown in the sea some offer their head bravely to those who cut them off some die under their torture and others perish with hunger and yet others be crucify some accord to the method commonly employ for malefactor others yet more cruelly be nail to the cross with their head downward and be kept alive until they perish on the cross with hunger chapter those in thebais it would be impossible to describe the outrage and torture which the martyr in thebais endure they be scrap over the entire body with shell instead of hook until they die woman be bound by one foot and raise aloft in the air by machine and with their body altogether bare and uncovered present to all beholder this most shameful cruel and inhuman spectacle others be bound to the branch and trunk of tree perish for they drew the stoutest branch together with machine and bound the limb of the martyr to them and then allow the branch to assume their natural position they tore asunder instantly the limb of those for whom they contrive this all these thing be do not for a few day or a short time but for a long series of year sometimes more than ten at other time above twenty be put to death again not less than thirty then about sixty and yet again a hundred men with young child and woman be slain in one day be condemn to various and diverse torment we also be on the spot ourselves have observe large crowd in one day some suffer decapitation others torture by fire so that the murderous sword be blunt and become weak be broken and the very executioner grow weary and relieve each other and we beheld the most wonderful ardor and the truly divine energy and zeal of those who believe in the christ of god for a soon a sentence be pronounce against the first one after another rush to the judgment seat and confess themselves christian and regard with indifference the terrible thing and the multiform torture they declare themselves boldly and undauntedly for the religion of the god of the universe and they receive the final sentence of death with joy and laughter and cheerfulness so that they sang and offer up hymn and thanksgiving to the god of the universe till their very last breath these indeed be wonderful but yet more wonderful be those who be distinguish for wealth noble birth and honor and for learn and philosophy held everything secondary to the true religion and to faith in our savior and lord jesus christ such an one be philoromus who held a high office under the imperial government at alexandria and who administer justice every day attend by a military guard correspond to his rank and roman dignity such also be phileas bishop of the church of thmuis a man eminent on account of his patriotism and the service render by him to his country and also on account of his philosophical learn these person although a multitude of relative and other friend besought them and many in high position and even the judge himself entreat them that they would have compassion on themselves and show mercy to their child and wife yet be not in the least induced by these thing to choose the love of life and to despise the ordinance of our savior concern confession and denial but with manly and philosophic mind or rather with pious and godloving soul they persevere against all the threat and insult of the judge and both of them be behead chapter the writing of phileas the martyr describe the occurrence at alexandria since we have mention phileas a have a high reputation for secular learn let him be his own witness in the follow extract in which he show u who he be and at the same time describes more accurately than we can the martyrdom which occur in his time at alexandria have before them all these example and model and noble token which be give u in the divine and sacred scripture the bless martyr who be with u do not hesitate but direct the eye of the soul in sincerity toward the god over all and have their mind set upon death for religion they adhere firmly to their call for they understood that our lord jesus christ have become man on our account that he might cut off all sin and furnish u with the mean of entrance into eternal life for he count it not a prize to be on an equality with god but empty himself take the form of a servant and be found in fashion a a man he humble himself unto death even the death of the cross wherefore also be zealous for the great gift the christbearing martyr endure all trial and all kind of contrivance for torture not once only but some also a second time and although the guard vied with each other in threaten them in all sort of way not in word only but in action they do not give up their resolution because perfect love casteth out fear what word could describe their courage and manliness under every torture for a liberty to abuse them be give to all that wish some beat them with club others with rod others with scourge yet others with thong and others with rope and the spectacle of the outrage be varied and exhibit great malignity for some with their hand bound behind them be suspend on the stock and every member stretch by certain machine then the torturer a command lacerate with instrument their entire body not only their side a in the case of murderer but also their stomach and knee and cheek others be raise aloft suspend from the porch by one hand and endure the most terrible suffer of all through the distension of their joint and limb others be bound face to face to pillar not rest on their foot but with the weight of their body bearing on their bond and draw them tightly and they endure this not merely a long a the governor talk with them or be at leisure but through almost the entire day for when he pass on to others he left officer under his authority to watch the first and observe if any of them overcome by the torture appear to yield and he command to cast them into chain without mercy and afterwards when they be at the last gasp to throw them to the ground and drag them away for he say that they be not to have the least concern for u but be to think and act a if we no longer exist our enemy have invent this second mode of torture in addition to the stripe some also after these outrage be place on the stock and have both their foot stretch over the four hole so that they be compel to lie on their back on the stock be unable to keep themselves up on account of the fresh wound with which their entire body be cover a a result of the scourge others be thrown on the ground and lay there under the accumulate infliction of torture exhibit to the spectator a more terrible manifestation of severity a they bore on their body the mark of the various and diverse punishment which have be invent a this go on some die under the torture sham the adversary by their constancy others half dead be shut up in prison and suffer with their agony they die in a few day but the rest recover under the care which they receive gain confidence by time and their long detention in prison when therefore they be order to choose whether they would be release from molestation by touch the pollute sacrifice and would receive from them the accurse freedom or refuse to sacrifice should be condemn to death they do not hesitate but go to death cheerfully for they knew what have be declare before by the sacred scripture for it be say he that sacrificeth to other god shall be utterly destroyed and thou shalt have no other god before me such be the word of the truly philosophical and godloving martyr which before the final sentence while yet in prison he address to the brother in his parish show them his own circumstance and at the same time exhort them to hold fast even after his approach death to the religion of christ but why need we dwell upon these thing and continue to add fresh instance of the conflict of the divine martyr throughout the world especially since they be dealt with no longer by common law but attack like enemy of war chapter those in phrygia a small town of phrygia inhabit solely by christian be completely surround by soldier while the men be in it throw fire into it they consume them with the woman and child while they be call upon christ this they do because all the inhabitant of the city and the curator himself and the governor with all who held office and the entire populace confess themselves christian and would not in the least obey those who command them to worship idol there be another man of roman dignity name adauctus of a noble italian family who have advanced through every honor under the emperor so that he have blamelessly fill even the general office of magistrate a they call it and of finance minister besides all this he excel in deed of piety and in the confession of the christ of god and be adorn with the diadem of martyrdom he endure the conflict for religion while still hold the office of finance minister chapter many others both men and woman who suffer in various way why need we mention the rest by name or number the multitude of the men or picture the various suffering of the admirable martyr of christ some of them be slain with the axe a in arabia the limb of some be broken a in cappadocia some raise on high by the foot with their head down while a gentle fire burn beneath them be suffocate by the smoke which arose from the burning wood a be do in mesopotamia others be mutilate by cut off their nose and ear and hand and cut to piece the other member and part of their body a in alexandria why need we revive the recollection of those in antioch who be roast on grate not so a to kill them but so a to subject them to a linger punishment or of others who prefer to thrust their right hand into the fire rather than touch the impious sacrifice some shrink from the trial rather than be take and fall into the hand of their enemy threw themselves from lofty house consider death preferable to the cruelty of the impious a certain holy person in soul admirable for virtue in body a woman who be illustrious beyond all in antioch for wealth and family and reputation have brought up in the principle of religion her two daughter who be now in the freshness and bloom of life since great envy be excite on their account every mean be use to find them in their concealment and when it be ascertain that they be away they be summon deceitfully to antioch thus they be caught in the net of the soldier when the woman saw herself and her daughter thus helpless and knew the thing terrible to speak of that men would do to them and the most unbearable of all terrible thing the threaten violation of their chastity she exhort herself and the maiden that they ought not to submit even to hear of this for she say that to surrender their soul to the slavery of demon be bad than all death and destruction and she set before them the only deliverance from all these thing escape to christ they then listen to her advice and after arrange their garment suitably they go aside from the middle of the road have request of the guard a little time for retirement and cast themselves into a river which be flow by thus they destroyed themselves but there be two other virgin in the same city of antioch who serve god in all thing and be true sister illustrious in family and distinguish in life young and blooming serious in mind pious in deportment and admirable for zeal a if the earth could not bear such excellence the worshiper of demon command to cast them into the sea and this be do to them in pontus others endure suffering horrible to hear their finger be pierce with sharp reed under their nail melt lead bubbling and boil with the heat be pour down the back of others and they be roast in the most sensitive part of the body others endure on their bowel and privy member shameful and inhuman and unmentionable torment which the noble and lawobserving judge to show their severity devise a more honorable manifestation of wisdom and new torture be continually invent a if they be endeavor by surpass one another to gain prize in a contest but at the close of these calamity when finally they could contrive no great cruelty and be weary of put to death and be fill and satiate with the shed of blood they turn to what they consider merciful and humane treatment so that they seem to be no longer devise terrible thing against u for they say that it be not fitting that the city should be pollute with the blood of their own people or that the government of their ruler which be kind and mild toward all should be defame through excessive cruelty but that rather the beneficence of the humane and royal authority should be extend to all and we should no longer be put to death for the infliction of this punishment upon u should be stop in consequence of the humanity of the ruler therefore it be command that our eye should be put out and that we should be maim in one of our limb for such thing be humane in their sight and the light of punishment for u so that now on account of this kindly treatment accord u by the impious it be impossible to tell the incalculable number of those whose right eye have first be cut out with the sword and then have be cauterize with fire or who have be disabled in the left foot by burning the joint and afterward condemn to the provincial copper mine not so much for service a for distress and hardship besides all these others encounter other trial which it be impossible to recount for their manly endurance surpasses all description in these conflict the noble martyr of christ shone illustrious over the entire world and everywhere astonish those who beheld their manliness and the evidence of the truly divine and unspeakable power of our savior be make manifest through them to mention each by name would be a long task if not indeed impossible chapter the bishop of the church that evince by their blood the genuineness of the religion which they preach a for the ruler of the church that suffer martyrdom in the principal city the first martyr of the kingdom of christ whom we shall mention among the monument of the pious be anthimus bishop of the city of nicomedia who be behead among the martyr at antioch be lucian a presbyter of that parish whose entire life be most excellent at nicomedia in the presence of the emperor he proclaim the heavenly kingdom of christ first in an oral defense and afterwards by deed a well of the martyr in phoenicia the most distinguish be those devote pastor of the spiritual flock of christ tyrannion bishop of the church of tyre zenobius a presbyter of the church at sidon and silvanus bishop of the church about emesa the last of these with others be make food for wild beast at emesa and be thus receive into the rank of martyr the other two glorify the word of god at antioch through patience unto death the bishop be thrown into the depth of the sea but zenobius who be a very skillful physician die through severe torture which be apply to his side of the martyr in palestine silvanus bishop of the church about gaza be behead with thirtynine others at the copper mine of phaeno there also the egyptian bishop peleus and nilus with others suffer death by fire among these we must mention pamphilus a presbyter who be the great glory of the parish of caesarea and among the men of our time most admirable the virtue of his manly deed we have record in the proper place of those who suffer death illustriously at alexandria and throughout egypt and thebais peter bishop of alexandria one of the most excellent teacher of the religion of christ should first be mention and of the presbyter with him faustus dius and ammonius perfect martyr of christ also phileas hesychius pachymius and theodorus bishop of egyptian church and besides them many other distinguish person who be commemorate by the parish of their country and region it be not for u to describe the conflict of those who suffer for the divine religion throughout the entire world and to relate accurately what happen to each of them this would be the proper work of those who be eyewitness of the event i will describe for posterity in another work those which i myself witness but in the present book i will add to what i have give the revocation issue by our persecutor and those event that occur at the begin of the persecution which will be most profitable to such a shall read them what word could sufficiently describe the greatness and abundance of the prosperity of the roman government before the war against u while the ruler be friendly and peaceable toward u then those who be high in the government and have held the position ten or twenty year pass their time in tranquil peace in festival and public game and most joyful pleasure and cheer while thus their authority be grow uninterruptedly and increase day by day suddenly they change their peaceful attitude toward u and begin an implacable war but the second year of this movement be not yet past when a revolution take place in the entire government and overturn all thing for a severe sickness come upon the chief of those of whom we have spoken by which his understand be distract and with him who be honor with the second rank he retire into private life scarcely have he do this when the entire empire be divide a thing which be not record a have ever occur before not long after the emperor constantius who through his entire life be most kindly and favorably dispose toward his subject and most friendly to the divine word end his life in the common course of nature and left his own son constantine a emperor and augustus in his stead he be the first that be ranked by them among the god and receive after death every honor which one could pay to an emperor he be the kindest and mild of emperor and the only one of those of our day that pass all the time of his government in a manner worthy of his office moreover he conduct himself toward all most favorably and beneficently he take not the small part in the war against u but preserve the pious that be under him unharmed and unabused he neither threw down the church building nor do he devise anything else against u the end of his life be honorable and thrice bless he alone at death left his empire happily and gloriously to his own son a his successor one who be in all respect most prudent and pious his son constantine enter on the government at once be proclaim supreme emperor and augustus by the soldier and long before by god himself the king of all he show himself an emulator of his father piety toward our doctrine such an one be he but after this licinius be declare emperor and augustus by a common vote of the ruler these thing grieve maximinus greatly for until that time he have be entitle by all only caesar he therefore be exceedingly imperious seize the dignity for himself and become augustus be make such by himself in the mean time he whom we have mention a have resume his dignity after his abdication be detect in conspire against the life of constantine perish by a most shameful death he be the first whose decree and statue and public monument be destroyed because of his wickedness and impiety chapter the character of the enemy of religion maxentius his son who obtain the government at rome at first feign our faith in complaisance and flattery toward the roman people on this account he command his subject to cease persecute the christian pretend to religion that he might appear merciful and mild beyond his predecessor but he do not prove in his deed to be such a person a be hop but ran into all wickedness and abstain from no impurity or licentiousness commit adultery and indulge in all kind of corruption for have separate wife from their lawful consort he abuse them and sent them back most dishonorably to their husband and he not only practice this against the obscure and unknown but he insult especially the most prominent and distinguish member of the roman senate all his subject people and ruler honor and obscure be worn out by grievous oppression neither although they kept quiet and bore the bitter servitude be there any relief from the murderous cruelty of the tyrant once on a small pretense he give the people to be slaughter by his guard and a great multitude of the roman populace be slain in the midst of the city with the spear and arm not of scythian and barbarian but of their own fellowcitizens it would be impossible to recount the number of senator who be put to death for the sake of their wealth multitude be slain on various pretense to crown all his wickedness the tyrant resort to magic and in his divination he cut open pregnant woman and again inspect the bowel of newborn infant he slaughter lion and perform various execrable act to invoke demon and avert war for his only hope be that by these mean victory would be secure to him it be impossible to tell the way in which this tyrant at rome oppress his subject so that they be reduce to such an extreme dearth of the necessity of life a have never be know accord to our contemporary either at rome or elsewhere but maximinus the tyrant in the east have secretly form a friendly alliance with the roman tyrant a with a brother in wickedness sought to conceal it for a long time but be at last detect he suffer merit punishment it be wonderful how akin he be in wickedness to the tyrant at rome or rather how far he surpass him in it for the chief of sorcerer and magiclans be honor by him with the high rank become exceedingly timid and superstitious he value greatly the error of idol and demon indeed without soothsayer and oracle he do not venture to move even a finger so to speak therefore he persecute u more violently and incessantly than his predecessor he order temple to be erect in every city and the sacred grove which have be destroyed through lapse of time to be speedily restore he appoint idol priest in every place and city and he set over them in every province a high priest some political official who have especially distinguish himself in every kind of service give him a band of soldier and a bodyguard and to all juggler a if they be pious and beloved of the god he grant government and the great privilege from this time on he distressed and harass not one city or country but all the province under his authority by extreme exaction of gold and silver and good and most grievous prosecution and various fine he take away from the wealthy the property which they have inherit from their ancestor and bestow vast rich and large sum of money on the flatterer about him and he go to such an excess of folly and drunkenness that his mind be derange and craze in his carousal and he give command when intoxicate of which he repent afterward when sober he suffer no one to surpass him in debauchery and profligacy but make himself an instructor in wickedness to those about him both ruler and subject he urge on the army to live wantonly in every kind of revelry and intemperance and encourage the governor and general to abuse their subject with rapacity and covetousness almost a if they be ruler with him why need we relate the licentious shameless deed of the man or enumerate the multitude with whom he commit adultery for he could not pas through a city without continually corrupt woman and ravish virgin and in this he succeed with all except the christian for a they despise death they care nothing for his power for the men endure fire and sword and crucifixion and wild beast and the depth of the sea and cut off of limb anti burning and prick and dig out of eye and mutilation of the entire body and besides these hunger and mine and bond in all they show patience in behalf of religion rather than transfer to idol the reverence due to god and the woman be not less manly than the men in behalf of the teach of the divine word a they endure conflict with the men and bore away equal prize of virtue and when they be drag away for corrupt purpose they surrender their life to death rather than their body to impurity one only of those who be seize for adulterous purpose by the tyrant a most distinguish and illustrious christian woman in alexandria conquer the passionate and intemperate soul of maximinus by most heroic firmness honorable on account of wealth and family and education she esteem all of these inferior to chastity he urge her many time but although she be ready to die he could not put her to death for his desire be strong than his anger he therefore punish her with exile and take away all her property many others unable even to listen to the threat of violation from the heathen ruler endure every form of torture and rackings and deadly punishment these indeed should be admire but far the most admirable be that woman at rome who be truly the most noble and modest of all whom the tyrant maxentius fully resemble maximinus in his action endeavor to abuse for when she learn that those who serve the tyrant in such matter be at the house she also be a christian and that her husband although a prefect of rome would suffer them to take and lead her away have request a little time for adorn her body she enter her chamber and be alone stabbed herself with a sword die immediately she left her corpse to those who have come for her and by her deed more powerfully than by any word she have show to all men now and hereafter that the virtue which prevails among christian be the only invincible and indestructible possession such be the career of wickedness which be carry forward at one and the same time by the two tyrant who held the east and the west who be there that would hesitate after careful examination to pronounce the persecution against u the cause of such evil especially since this extreme confusion of affair do not cease until the christian have obtain liberty chapter the event which happen to the heathen during the entire ten year of the persecution they be constantly plot and war against one another for the sea could not be navigate nor could men sail from any port without be expose to all kind of outrage be stretch on the rack and lacerate in their side that it might be ascertain through various torture whether they come from the enemy and finally be subject to punishment by the cross or by fire and besides these thing shield and breastplate be prepare and dart and spear and other warlike accouterment be make ready and galley and naval armor be collect in every place and no one expect anything else than to be attack by enemy any day in addition to this famine and pestilence come upon them in regard to which we shall relate what be necessary in the proper place chapter the change of affirms for the well such be the state of affair during the entire persecution but in the tenth year through the grace of god it cease altogether have begin to decrease after the eighth year for when the divine and heavenly grace show u favorable and propitious oversight then truly our ruler and the very person by whom the war against u have be earnestly prosecute most remarkably change their mind and issue a revocation and quenched the great fire of persecution which have be kindle by merciful proclamation and ordinance concern u but this be not due to any human agency nor be it the result a one might say of the compassion or philanthropy of our ruler far from it for daily from the begin until that time they be devise more and more severe measure against u and continually invent outrage by a great variety of instrument but it be manifestly due to the oversight of divine providence on the one i hand become reconcile to his people and on the other attack him a who instigate these evil and show anger toward him a the author of the cruelty of the entire persecution for though it be necessary that these thing should take place accord to the divine judgment yet the word saith woe to him through whom the offense cometh therefore punishment from god come upon him begin with his flesh and proceed to his soul for an abscess suddenly appear in the midst of the secret part of his body and from it a deeply perforate sore which spread irresistibly into his inmost bowel an indescribable multitude of worm sprang from them and a deathly odor arose a the entire bulk of his body have through his gluttony be change before his sickness into an excessive mass of soft fat which become putrid and thus present an awful and intolerable sight to those who come near some of the physician be wholly unable to endure the exceed offensiveness of the odor be slain others a the entire mass have swollen and pass beyond hope of restoration and they be unable to render any help be put to death without mercy chapter the revocation of the ruler wrestling with so many evil he thought of the cruelty which he have commit against the pious turn therefore his thought toward himself he first openly confess to the god of the universe and then summon his attendant he command that without delay they should stop the persecution of the christian and should by law and royal decree urge them forward to build their church and to perform their customary worship offering prayer in behalf of the emperor immediately the deed follow the word the imperial decree be publish in the city contain the revocation of the act against u in the follow form the emperor caesar galerius valerius maximinus invictus augustus pontifex maximus conqueror of the german conqueror of the egyptian conqueror of the theban five time conqueror of the sarmatians conqueror of the persian twice conqueror of the carpathians six time conqueror of the armenian conqueror of the medes conqueror of the adiabeni tribune of the people the twentieth time emperor the nineteenth time consul the eighth time father of his country proconsul and the emperor caesar flavius valerius constantinus pin felix invictus augustus pontifex maximus tribune of the people emperor the fifth time consul father of his country proconsul and the emperor caesar valerius licinius pin felix invictus augustus pontifex maximus tribune of the people the fourth time emperor the third time consul father of his country proconsul to the people of their province greet among the other thing which we have ordain for the public advantage and profit we formerly wish to restore everything to conformity with the ancient law and public discipline of the roman and to provide that the christian also who have forsaken the religion of their ancestor should return to a good disposition for in some way such arrogance have seize them and such stupidity have overtaken them that they do not follow the ancient institution which possibly their own ancestor have formerly establish but make for themselves law accord to their own purpose a each one desire and observe them and thus assemble a separate congregation in various place when we have issue this decree that they should return to the institution establish by the ancient a great many submit under danger but a great many be harass endure all kind of death and since many continue in the same folly and we perceive that they neither offer to the heavenly god the worship which be due nor pay regard to the god of the christian in consideration of our philanthropy and our invariable custom by which we be wont to extend pardon to all we have determine that we ought most cheerfully to extend our indulgence in this matter also that they may again be christian and may rebuild the conventicle in which they be accustom to assemble on condition that nothing be do by them contrary to discipline in another letter we shall indicate to the magistrate what they have to observe wherefore on account of this indulgence of ours they ought to supplicate their god for our safety and that of the people and their own that the public welfare may be preserve in every place and that they may live securely in their several home such be the tenor of this edict translate a well a possible from the roman tongue into the greek it be time to consider what take place after these event that which follow be found in some copy in the eighth book the author of the edict very shortly after this confession be release from his pain and die he be report to have be the original author of the misery of the persecution have endeavor long before the movement of the other emperor to turn from the faith the christian in the army and first of all those in his own house degrade some from the military rank and abuse others most shamefully and threaten still others with death and finally incite his partner in the empire to the general persecution it be not proper to pas over the death of these emperor in silence a four of them held the supreme authority those who be advanced in age and honor after the persecution have continued not quite two year abdicate the government a we have already state and pass the remainder of their life in a common and private station the end of their life be a follow he who be first in honor and age perish through a long and most grievous physical infirmity he who held the second place end his life by strangle suffer thus accord to a certain demoniacal prediction on account of his many dare crime of those after them the last of whom we have spoken a the originator of the entire persecution suffer such thing a we have related but he who precede him the most merciful and kindly emperor constantius pass all the time of his government in a manner worthy of his office moreover he conduct himself towards all most favorably and beneficently he take not the small part in the war against u and preserve the pious that be under him unharmed and unabused neither do he throw down the church building nor devise anything else against u the end of his life be happy and thrice bless he alone at death left his empire happily and gloriously to his own son a his successor one who be in all respect most prudent and pious he enter on the government at once be proclaim supreme emperor and augustus by the soldier and he show himself an emulator of his father piety toward our doctrine such be the death of the four of whom we have write which take place at different time of these moreover only the one refer to a little above by u with those who afterward share in the government finally publish openly to all the abovementioned confession in the write edict which he issue martyr of palestine the follow also we found in a certain copy in the eighth book it be in the nineteenth year of the reign of diocletian in the month xanthicus which be call april by the roman about the time of the feast of our savior passion while flavianus be governor of the province of palestine that letter be publish everywhere command that the church be level to the ground and the scripture be destroyed by fire and order that those who held place of honor be degrade and that the household servant if they persist in the profession of christianity be deprive of freedom such be the force of the first edict against u but not long after other letter be issue command that all the bishop of the church everywhere be first thrown into prison and afterward by every artifice be compel to sacrifice chapter the first of the martyr of palestine be procopius who before he have receive the trial of imprisonment immediately on his first appearance before the governor tribunal have be order to sacrifice to the socalled god declare that he knew only one to whom it be proper to sacrifice a he himself will but when he be command to offer libation to the four emperor have quote a sentence which displeased them he be immediately behead the quotation be from the poet the rule of many be not good let there be one ruler and one king it be the seventh day of the month desius the seventh before the ides of june a the roman reckon and the fourth day of the week when this first example be give at caesura in palestine afterwards in the same city many ruler of the country church readily endure terrible suffering and furnish to the beholder an example of noble conflict but others benumbed in spirit by terror be easily weaken at the first onset of the rest each one endure different form of torture a scourgings without number and rackings and tearing of their side and insupportable fetter by which the hand of some be dislocate yet they endure what come upon them a in accordance with the inscrutable purpose of god for the hand of one be seize and he be lead to the altar while they thrust into his right hand the pollute and abominable offering and he be dismiss a if he have sacrifice another have not even touch it yet when others say that he have sacrifice he go away in silence another be take up half dead be cast aside a if already dead and release from his bond and count among the sacrificer when another cry out and testify that he would not obey he be struck in the mouth and silence by a large band of those who be drawn up for this purpose and driven away by force even though he have not sacrifice of such consequence do they consider it to seem by any mean to have accomplish their purpose therefore of all this number the only one who be honor with the crown of the holy martyr be alphaeus and zacchaeus after stripe and scraping and severe bond and additional torture and various other trial and after have their foot stretch for a night and day over four hole in the stock on the seventeenth day of the month dius that be accord to the roman the fifteenth before the kalends of december have confess one only god and christ jesus a king a if they have uttered some blasphemy they be behead like the former martyr chapter what occur to romanus on the same day at antioch be also worthy of record for he be a native of palestine a deacon and exorcist in the parish of caesarea and be present at the destruction of the church he beheld many men with woman and child go up in crowd to the idol and sacrifice but through his great zeal for religion he could not endure the sight and rebuke them with a loud voice be arrest for his boldness he prove a most noble witness of the truth if there ever be one for when the judge inform him that he be to die by fire he receive the sentence with cheerful countenance and most ready mind and be lead away when he be bound to the stake and the wood pile up around him a they be await the arrival of the emperor before light the fire he cry where be the fire for me have say this he be summon again before the emperor and subject to the unusual torture of have his tongue cut out but he endure this with fortitude and show to all by his deed that the divine power be present with those who endure any hardship whatever for the sake of religion lighten their suffering and strengthen their zeal when he learn of this strange mode of punishment the noble man be not terrify but put out his tongue readily and offer it with the great alacrity to those who cut it off after this punishment he be thrown into prison and suffer there for a very long time at last the twentieth anniversary of the emperor be near when accord to an establish gracious custom liberty be proclaim everywhere to all who be in bond he alone have both his foot stretch over five hole in the stock and while he lay there be strangle and be thus honor with martyrdom a he desire although he be outside of his country yet a he be a native of palestine it be proper to count him among the palestinian martyr these thing occur in this manner during the first year when the persecution be direct only against the ruler of the church chapter in the course of the second year the persecution against u increase greatly and at that time urbanus be governor of the province imperial edict be first issue to him command by a general decree that all the people should sacrifice at once in the different city and offer libation to the idol in gaza a city of palestine timotheus endure countless torture and afterwards be subject to a slow and moderate fire have give by his patience in all his suffering most genuine evidence of sincerest piety toward the deity he bore away the crown of the victorious athlete of religion at the same time agapius and our contemporary thecla have exhibit most noble constancy be condemn a food for the wild beast but who that beheld these thing would not have admire or if they heard of them by report would not have be astonish for when the heathen everywhere be hold a festival and the customary show it be noise abroad that besides the other entertainment the public combat of those who have lately be condemn to wild beast would also take place a this report increase and spread in all direction six young men namely timolaus a native of pontus dionysius from tripoli in phoenicia romulus a subdeacon of the parish of diospolis paesis and alexander both egyptian and another alexander from gaza have first bound their own hand go in haste to urbanus who be about to open the exhibition evidence great zeal for martyrdom they confess that they be christian and by their ambition for all terrible thing show that those who glory in the religion of the god of the universe do not cower before the attack of wild beast immediately after create no ordinary astonishment in the governor and those who be with him they be cast into prison after a few day two others be add to them one of them name agapius have in former confession endure dreadful torment of various kind the other who have supply them with the necessary of life be call dionysius all of these eight be behead on one day at caesarea on the twentyfourth day of the month dystrus which be the ninth before the kalends of april meanwhile a change in the emperor occur and the first of them all in dignity and the second retire into private life and public affair begin to be troubled shortly after the roman government be come divide against itself and a cruel war arose among them and this division with the trouble which grow out of it be not settle until peace toward u have be establish throughout the entire roman empire for when this peace arose for all a the daylight after the darkest and most gloomy night the public affair of the roman government be reestablish and become happy and peaceful and the ancestral goodwill toward each other be revive but we will relate these thing more fully at the proper time now let u return to the regular course of event chapter maximinus caesar have come at that time into the government a if to manifest to all the evidence of his reborn enmity against god and of his impiety arm himself for persecution against u more vigorously than his predecessor in consequence no little confusion arose among all and they scatter here and there endeavor in some way to escape the danger and there be great commotion everywhere but what word would suffice for a suitable description of the divine love and boldness in confess god of the bless and truly innocent lamb i refer to the martyr apphianus who present in the sight of all before the gate of caesarea a wonderful example of piety toward the only god he be at that time not twenty year old he have first spent a long time at berytus for the sake of a secular grecian education a he belong to a very wealthy family it be wonderful to relate how in such a city he be superior to youthful passion and clung to virtue uncorrupted neither by his bodily vigor nor his young companion living discreetly soberly and piously in accordance with his profession of the christian doctrine and the life of his teacher if it be needful to mention his native country and give honor to it a produce this noble athlete of piety we will do so with pleasure the young man come from pagae if any one be acquaint with the place a city in lycia of no mean importance after his return from his course of study in berytus though his father held the first place in his country he could not bear to live with him and his relative a it do not please them to live accord to the rule of religion therefore a if he be lead by the divine spirit and in accordance with a natural or rather an inspire and true philosophy regard this preferable to what be consider the glory of life and despise bodily comfort he secretly left his family and because of his faith and hope in god pay no attention to his daily need he be lead by the divine spirit to the city of caesarea where be prepared for him the crown of martyrdom for piety abide with u there and confer with u in the divine scripture diligently for a short time and fitting himself zealously by suitable exercise he exhibit such an end a would astonish any one should it be see again who that hears of it would not justly admire his courage boldness constancy and even more than these the dare deed itself which evidence a zeal for religion and a spirit truly superhuman for in the second attack upon u under maximinus in the third year of the persecution edict of the tyrant be issue for the first time command that the ruler of the city should diligently and speedily see to it that all the people offer sacrifice throughout the city of caesarea by command of the governor the herald be summon men woman and child to the temple of the idol and besides this the chiliarchs be call out each one by name from a roll and an immense crowd of the wicked be rush together from all quarter then this youth fearlessly while no one be aware of his intention elude both u who live in the house with him and the whole band of soldier that surround the governor and rush up to urbanus a he be offering libation and fearlessly seize him by the right hand straightway put a stop to his sacrifice and skillfully and persuasively with a certain divine inspiration exhort him to abandon his delusion because it be not well to forsake the one and only true god and sacrifice to idol and demon it be probable that this be do by the youth through a divine power which lead him forward and which all but cry aloud in his act that christian who be truly such be so far from abandon the religion of the god of the universe which they have once espouse that they be not only superior to threat and the punishment which follow but yet bolder to speak with noble and untrammeled tongue and if possible to summon even their persecutor to turn from their ignorance and acknowledge the only true god thereupon he of whom we be speak and that instantly a might have be expect after so bold a deed be torn by the governor and those who be with him a if by wild beast and have endure manfully in numerable blow over his entire body he be straightway cast into prison there he be stretch by the tormentor with both his foot in the stock for a night and a day and the next day he be brought before the judge a they endeavor to force him to surrender he exhibit all constancy under suffer and terrible torture his side be torn not once or twice but many time to the bone and the very bowel and he receive so many blow on his face and neck that those who for a long time have be well acquaint with him could not recognize his swollen face but a he would not yield under this treatment the torturer a command cover his foot with linen cloth soak in oil and set them on fire no word can describe the agony which the bless one endure from this for the fire consume his flesh and penetrate to his bone so that the humor of his body be melt and ooze out and drop down like wax but a he be not subdue by this his adversary be defeat and unable to comprehend his superhuman constancy cast him again into prison a third time he be brought before the judge and have witness the same profession be half dead he be finally thrown into the depth of the sea but what happen immediately after this will scarcely be believe by those who do not see it although we realize this yet we must record the event of which to speak plainly all the inhabitant of caesarea be witness for truly there be no age but beheld this marvelous sight for a soon a they have cast this truly sacred and thrice bless youth into the fathomless depth of the sea an uncommon commotion and disturbance agitate the sea and all the shore about it so that the land and the entire city be shaken by it and at the same time with this wonderful and sudden perturbation the sea threw out before the gate of the city the body of the divine martyr a if unable to endure it such be the death of the wonderful apphianus it occur on the second day of the month xanthicus which be the fourth day before the none of april on the day of preparation chapter about the same time in the city of tyre a youth name ulpianus after dreadful torture and most severe scourgings be enclose in a raw oxhide with a dog and with one of those poisonous reptile an asp and cast into the sea wherefore i think that we may properly mention him in connection with the martyrdom of apphianus shortly afterwards aedesius a brother of apphianus not only in god but also in the flesh be a son of the same earthly father endure suffering like his after very many confession and protract torture in bond and after he have be sentence by the governor to the mine in palestine he conduct himself through them all in a truly philosophic manner for he be more highly educate than his brother and have prosecute philosophic study finally in the city of alexandria when he beheld the judge who be try the christian offend beyond all bound now insult holy men in various way and again consign woman of great modesty and even religious virgin to procurer for shameful treatment he act like his brother for a these thing seem insufferable he go forward with bold resolve and with his word and deed overwhelmed the judge with shame and disgrace after suffer in consequence many form of torture he endure a death similar to his brother be cast into the sea but these thing a i have say happen to him in this way a little later chapter in the fourth year of the persecution against u on the twelfth day before the kalends of december which be the twentieth day of the month dius on the day before the sabbath while the tyrant maximinus be present and give magnificent show in honor of his birthday the follow event truly worthy of record occur in the city of caesarea a it be an ancient custom to furnish the spectator more splendid show when the emperor be present than at other time new and foreign spectacle take the place of the customary amusement such a animal brought from india or ethiopia or other place or men who could astonish the beholder with skillful bodily exercise it be necessary at this time a the emperor be give the exhibition to add to the show something more wonderful and what should this be a witness of our doctrine be brought into the midst and endure the contest for the true and only religion this be agapius who a we have state a little above be with thecla the second to be thrown to the wild beast for food he have also three time and more march with malefactor from the prison to the arena and every time after threat from the judge whether in compassion or in hope that he might change his mind have be reserve for other conflict but the emperor be present he be brought out at this time a if he have be appropriately reserve for this occasion until the very word of the savior should be fulfil in him which through divine knowledge he declare to his disciple that they should be brought before king on account of their testimony unto him he be take into the midst of the arena with a certain malefactor who they say be charge with the murder of his master but this murderer of his master when he have be cast to the wild beast be deem worthy of compassion and humanity almost like barabbas in the time of our savior and the whole theater resound with shout and cry of approval because the murderer be humanely save by the emperor and deem worthy of honor and freedom but the athlete of religion be first summon by the tyrant and promise liberty if he would deny his profession but he testify with a loud voice that not for any fault but for the religion of the creator of the universe he would readily and with pleasure endure whatever might be inflict upon him have say this he join the deed to the word and rush to meet a bear which have be let loose against him surrender himself most cheerfully to be devour by him after this a he still breathe he be cast into prison and living yet one day stone be bound to his foot and he be drown in the depth of the sea such be the martyrdom of agapius chapter again in caesarea when the persecution have continued to the fifth year on the second day of the month xanthicus which be the fourth before the none of april on the very lord day of our savior resurrection theodosia a virgin from tyre a faithful and sedate maiden not yet eighteen year of age go up to certain prisoner who be confess the kingdom of christ and sit before the judgment seat and salute them and a be probable besought them to remember her when they come before the lord thereupon a if she have commit a profane and impious act the soldier seize her and lead her to the governor and he immediately like a madman and a wild beast in his anger torture her with dreadful and most terrible torment in her side and breast even to the very bone and a she still breathe and withal stood with a joyful and beam countenance he order her thrown into the wave of the sea then passing from her to the other confessor he condemn all of them to the copper mine in phaeno in palestine afterwards on the fifth of the month dius on the none of november accord to the roman in the same city silvanus who at that time be a presbyter and confessor but who shortly after be honor with the episcopate and die a martyr and those with him men who have show the noble firmness in behalf of religion be condemn by him to labor in the same copper mine command be first give that their ankle be disabled with hot iron at the same time he deliver to the flame a man who be illustrious through numerous other confession this be domninus who be well know to all in palestine for his exceed fearlessness after this the same judge who be a cruel contriver of suffer and an inventor of device against the doctrine of christ plan against the pious punishment that have never be heard of he condemn three to single pugilistic combat he deliver to be devour by wild beast auxentius a grave and holy old man others who be in mature life he make eunuch and condemn them to the same mine yet others after severe torture he cast into prison among these be my dearest friend pamphilus who be by reason of every virtue the most illustrious of the martyr in our time urbanus first test him in rhetorical philosophy and learn and afterwards endeavor to compel him to sacrifice but a he saw that he refuse and in nowise regard his threat be exceedingly angry he order him to be torment with severest torture and when the brutal man after he have almost satiate himself with these torture by continuous and prolong scraping in his side be yet cover with shame before all he put him also with the confessor in prison but what recompense for his cruelty to the saint he who thus abuse the martyr of christ shall receive from the divine judgment may be easily determine from the prelude to it in which immediately and not long after his dare cruelty against pamphilus while he yet held the government the divine judgment come upon him for thus suddenly he who but yesterday be judging on the lofty tribunal guard by a band of soldier and ruling over the whole nation of palestine the associate and dearest friend and table companion of the tyrant himself be strip in one night and overwhelmed with disgrace and shame before those who have formerly admire him a if he be himself an emperor and he appear cowardly and unmanly utter womanish cry and supplication to all the people whom he have rule and maximinus himself in reliance upon whose favor urbanus be formerly so arrogantly insolent a if he love him exceedingly for his deed against u be set a a harsh and most severe judge in this same caesarea to pronounce sentence of death against him for the great disgrace of the crime of which he be convict let u say this in passing a suitable time may come when we shall have leisure to relate the end and the fate of those impious men who especially fought against u both of maximinus himself and those with him chapter up to the sixth year the storm have be incessantly rag against u before this time there have be a very large number of confessor of religion in the socalled porphyry quarry in thebais which get it name from the stone found there of these one hundred men lack three together with woman and infant be sent to the governor of palestine when they confess the god of the universe and christ firmilianus who have be sent there a governor in the place of urbanus direct in accordance with the imperial command that they should be maim by burning the sinew of the ankle of their left foot and that their right eye with the eyelid and pupil should first be cut out and then destroyed by hot iron to the very root and he then sent them to the mine in the province to endure hardship with severe toil and suffer but it be not sufficient that these only who suffer such misery should be deprive of their eye but those native of palestine also who be mention just above a condemn to pugilistic combat since they would neither receive food from the royal storehouse nor undergo the necessary preparatory exercise have be brought on this account not only before the overseer but also before maximinus himself and have manifest the noble persistence in confession by the endurance of hunger and stripe they receive like punishment with those whom we have mention and with them other confessor in the city of caesarea immediately afterwards others who be gather to hear the scripture read be seize in gaza and some endure the same suffering in the foot and eye but others be afflict with yet great torment and with most terrible torture in the side one of these in body a woman but in understand a man would not endure the threat of fornication and spoke directly against the tyrant who entrust the government to such cruel judge she be first scourge and then raise aloft on the stake and her side lacerate a those appoint for this purpose apply the torture incessantly and severely at the command of the judge another with mind fix like the former on virginity a her aim a woman who be altogether mean in forth and contemptible in appearance but on the other hand strong in soul and endow with an understand superior to her body be unable to bear the merciless and cruel and inhuman deed with a boldness beyond that of the combatant famed among the greek cry out to the judge from the midst of the crowd and how long will you thus cruelly torture my sister but he be greatly enrage and order the woman to be immediately seize thereupon she be brought forward and have call herself by the august name of the savior she be first urge by word to sacrifice and a she refuse she be drag by force to the altar but her sister continued to maintain her former zeal and with intrepid and resolute foot kick the altar and overturn it with the fire that be on it thereupon the judge enrage like a wild beast inflict on her such torture in her side a he never have on any one before strive almost to glut himself with her raw flesh but when his madness be satiate he bound them both together this one and her whom she call sister and condemn them to death by fire it be say that the first of these be from the country of gaza the other by name valentina be of caesarea and be well know to many but how can i describe a it deserves the martyrdom which follow with which the thriceblessed paul be honor he be condemn to death at the same time with them under one sentence at the time of his martyrdom a the executioner be about to cut off his head he request a brief respite this be grant he first in a clear and distinct voice supplicate god in behalf of his fellowchristians pray for their pardon and that freedom might soon be restore to them then he ask for the conversion of the jew to god through christ and proceed in order he request the same thing for the samaritan and besought that those gentile who be in error and be ignorant of god might come to a knowledge of him and adopt the true religion nor do he leave neglect the mixed multitude who be stand around after all these oh great and unspeakable forbearance he entreat the god of the universe for the judge who have condemn him to death and for the high ruler and also for the one who be about to behead him in his hearing and that of all present beseeching that their sin toward him should not be reckon against them have prayed for these thing with a loud voice and have a one who be die unjustly move almost all to compassion and tear of his own accord he make himself ready and submit his bare neck to the stroke of the sword and be adorn with divine martyrdom this take place on the twentyfifth day of the month panemus which be the eighth before the kalends of august such be the end of these person but not long after one hundred and thirty admirable athlete of the confession of christ from the land of egypt endure in egypt itself at the command of maximinus the same affliction in their eye and foot with the former person and be sent to the abovementioned mine in palestine but some of them be condemn to the mine in cilicia chapter after such noble act of the distinguish martyr of christ the flame of persecution lessen and be quenched a it be by their sacred blood and relief and liberty be grant to those who for christ sake be labor in the mine of thebais and for a little time we be begin to breath pure air but by some new impulse i know not what he who held the power to persecute be again arouse against the christian immediately letter from maximinus against u be publish everywhere in every province the governor and the military prefect urge by edict and letter and public ordinance the magistrate and general and notary in all the city to carry out the imperial decree which order that the altar of the idol should with all speed be rebuilt and that all men woman and child even infant at the breast should sacrifice and offer oblation and that with diligence and care they should cause them to taste of the execrable offering and that the thing for sale in the market should be pollute with libation from the sacrifice and that guard should be station before the bath in order to defile with the abominable sacrifice those who go to wash in them when these order be be carry out our people a be natural be at the begin greatly distressed in mind and even the unbelieving heathen blame the severity and the exceed absurdity of what be do for these thing appear to them extreme and burdensome a the heaviest storm impend over all in every quarter the divine power of our savior again infuse such boldness into his athlete that without be drawn on or drag forward by any one they spurn the threat three of the faithful join together rush on the governor a he be sacrifice to the idol and cry out to him to cease from his delusion there be no other god than the maker and creator of the universe when he ask who they be they confess boldly that they be christian thereupon firmilianus be greatly enrage sentence them to capital punishment without inflict torture upon them the name of the eldest of these be antoninus of the next zebinas who be a native of eleutheropolis and of the third germanus this take place on the thirteenth of the month dius the ides of november there be associate with them on the same day ennathas a woman from scythopolis who be adorn with the chaplet of virginity she do not indeed do a they have do but be drag by force and brought before the judge she endure scourgings and cruel insult which maxys a tribune of a neighbor district without the knowledge of the superior authority dare to inflict upon her he be a man bad than his name sanguinary in other respect exceedingly harsh and altogether cruel and censure by all who knew him this man strip the bless woman of all her clothing so that she be cover only from her loin to her foot and the rest of her body be bare and he lead her through the entire city of caesarea and regard it a a great thing to beat her with thong while she be drag through all the marketplace after such treatment she manifest the noble constancy at the judgment seat of the governor himself and the judge condemn her to be burn alive he also carry his rage against the pious to a most inhuman length and transgress the law of nature not be ashamed even to deny burial to the lifeless body of the sacred men thus he order the dead to be expose in the open air a food for wild beast and to be watch carefully by night and day for many day a large number of men attend to this savage and barbarous decree and they look out from their post of observation a if it be a matter worthy of care to see that the dead body should not be steal and wild beast and dog and bird of prey scatter the human limb here and there and the whole city be strew with the entrails and bone of men so that nothing have ever appear more dreadful and horrible even to those who formerly hat u though they bewail not so much the calamity of those against whom these thing be do a the outrage against themselves and the common nature of man for there be to be see near the gate a spectacle beyond all description and tragic recital for not only be human flesh devour in one place but it be scatter in every place so that some say that limb and mass of flesh and part of entrails be to be see even within the gate after these thing have continued for many day a wonderful event occur the air be clear and bright and the appearance of the sky most serene when suddenly throughout the city from the pillar which support the public porch many drop fell like tear and the market place and street though there be no mist in the air be moisten with sprinkle water whence i know not then immediately it be report everywhere that the earth unable to endure the abomination of these thing have shed tear in a mysterious manner and that a a rebuke to the relentless and unfeeling nature of men stone and lifeless wood have wept for what have happen i know well that this account may perhaps appear idle and fabulous to those who come after u but not to those to whom the truth be confirm at the time chapter on the fourteenth day of the follow month appellaeus the nineteenth before the kalends of january certain person from egypt be again seize by those who examine people passing the gate they have be sent to minister to the confessor in cilicia they receive the same sentence a those whom they have go to help be mutilate in their eye and foot three of them exhibit in ascalon where they be imprison marvelous bravery in the endurance of various kind of martyrdom one of them name are be condemn to the flame and the others call probus and elia be behead on the eleventh day of the month audynaeus which be the third before the ides of january in the same city of caesarea peter an ascetic also call apselamus from the village of anea on the border of eleutheropolis like purest gold give noble proof by fire of his faith in the christ of god though the judge and those around him besought him many time to have compassion on himself and to spare his own youth and bloom he disregard them prefer hope in the god of the universe to all thing even to life itself a certain asclepius suppose to be a bishop of the sect of marcion possess a he thought with zeal for religion but not accord to knowledge end his life on one and the same funeral pyre these thing take place in this manner chapter it be time to describe the great and celebrate spectacle of pamphilus a man thrice dear to me and of those who finish their course with him they be twelve in all be count worthy of apostolic grace and number of these the leader and the only one honor with the position of presbyter at caesarea be pamphilus a man who through his entire life be celebrate for every virtue for renounce and despise the world for share his possession with the needy for contempt of earthly hope and for philosophic deportment and exercise he especially excel all in our time in most sincere devotion to the divine scripture and indefatigable industry in whatever he undertook and in his helpfulness to his relative and associate in a separate treatise on his life consist of three book we have already described the excellence of his virtue refer to this work those who delight in such thing and desire to know them let u now consider the martyr in order second after pamphilus vale who be honor for his venerable gray hair enter the contest he be a deacon from aelia an old man of gravest appearance and verse in the divine scripture if any one ever be he have so laid up the memory of them in his heart that he do not need to look at the book if he undertook to repeat any passage of scripture the third be paul from the city of jamna who be know among them a most zealous and fervent in spirit previous to his martyrdom he have endure the conflict of confession by cauterization after these person have continued in prison for two entire year the occasion of their martyrdom be a second arrival of egyptian brother who suffer with them they have accompany the confessor in cilicia to the mine there and be return to their home at the entrance of the gate of caesarea the guard who be men of barbarous character question them a to who they be and whence they come they kept back nothing of the truth and be seize a malefactor take in the very act they be five in number when brought before the tyrant be very bold in his presence they be immediately thrown into prison on the next day which be the nineteenth of the month peritius accord to the roman reckon the fourteenth before the kalends of march they be brought accord to command before the judge with pamphilus and his associate whom we have mention first by all kind of torture through the invention of strange and various machine he test the invincible constancy of the egyptian have practice these cruelty upon the leader of all he ask him first who he be he heard in reply the name of some prophet instead of his proper name for it be their custom in place of the name of idol give them by their father if they have such to take other name so that you would hear them call themselves elijah or jeremiah or isaiah or samuel or daniel thus show themselves inwardly true jew and the genuine israel of god not only in deed but in the name which they bore when firmilianus have heard some such name from the martyr and do not understand the force of the word he ask next the name of his country but he give a second answer similar to the former say that jerusalem be his country meaning that of which paul say jerusalem which be above be free which be our mother and ye be come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem this be what he meant but the judge think only of the earth sought diligently to discover what that city be and in what part of the world it be situate and therefore he apply torture that the truth might be acknowledge but the man with his hand twist behind his back and his foot crush by strange machine assert firmly that he have spoken the truth and be question again repeatedly what and where the city be of which he spoke he say that it be the country of the pious alone for no others should have a place in it and that it lay toward the far east and the rise sun he philosophize about these thing accord to his own understand and be in nowise turn froth them by the torture with which he be afflict on every side and a if he be without flesh or body he seem insensible of his suffering but the judge be perplexed be impatient think that the christian be about to establish a city somewhere inimical and hostile to the roman and he inquire much about this and investigate where that country toward the east be locate but when he have for a long time lacerate the young man with scourgings and punish him with all sort of torment he perceive that his persistence in what he have say could not be change and pass against him sentence of death such a scene be exhibit by what be do to this man and have inflict similar torture on the others he sent them away in the same manner then be weary and perceive that he punish the men in vain have satiate his desire he proceed against pamphilus and his companion and have learn that already under former torture they have manifest an unchangeable zeal for the faith he ask them if they would now obey and receive from every one of them only this one answer a their last word of confession in martyrdom he inflict on them punishment similar to the others when this have be do a young man one of the household servant of pamphilus who have be educate in the noble life and instruction of such a man learn the sentence pass upon his master cry out from the midst of the crowd ask that their body might be bury thereupon the judge not a man but a wild beast or if anything more savage than a wild beast give no consideration to the young man age ask him only the same question when he learn that he confess himself a christian a if he have be wound by a dart swell with rage he order the tormentor to use their utmost power against him and when he saw that he refuse to sacrifice a command he order them to scrape him continually to his very bone and to the inmost recess of his bowel not a if he be human flesh but a if he be stone or wood or any lifeless thing but after long persistence he saw that this be in vain a the man be speechless and insensible and almost lifeless his body be worn out by the torture but be inflexibly merciless and inhuman he order him to be commit straightway a he be to a slow fire and before the death of his earthly master though he have enter later on the conflict he receive release from the body while those who have be zealous about the others be yet delay one could then see porphyry like one who have come off victorious in every conflict his body cover with dust but his countenance cheerful after such suffering with courageous and exult mind advance to death and a if truly fill with the divine spirit cover only with his philosophic robe thrown about him a a cloak soberly and intelligently he direct his friend a to what he wish and beckon to them preserve still a cheerful countenance even at the stake but when the fire be kindle at some distance around him in a circle have inhale the flame into his mouth he continued most nobly in silence from that time till his death after the single word which he uttered when the flame first touch him and he cry out for the help of jesus the son of god such be the contest of porphyry his death be report to pamphilus by a messenger seleucus he be one of the confessor from the army a the bearer of such a message he be forthwith deem worthy of a similar lot for a soon a he related the death of porphyry and have salute one of the martyr with a kiss some of the soldier seize him and lead him to the governor and he a if he would hasten him on to be a companion of the former on the way to heaven command that he be put to death immediately this man be from cappadocia and belong to the select band of soldier and have obtain no small honor in those thing which be esteem among the roman for in stature and bodily strength and size and vigor he far excel his fellowsoldiers so that his appearance be matter of common talk and his whole form be admire on account of it size and symmetrical proportion at the begin of the persecution he be prominent in the conflict of confession through his patience under scourge after he left the army he set himself to imitate zealously the religious ascetic and a if he be their father and guardian he show himself a bishop and patron of destitute orphan and defenseless widow and of those who be distressed with penury or sickness it be likely that on this account he be deem worthy of an extraordinary call to martyrdom by god who rejoices in such thing more than in the smoke and blood of sacrifice he be the tenth athlete among those whom we have mention a meeting their end on one and the same day on this day a be fitting the chief gate be open and a ready way of entrance into the kingdom of heaven be give to the martyr pamphilus and to the others with him in the footstep of seleucus come theodulus a grave and pious old man who belong to the governor household and have be honor by firmilianus himself more than all the others in his house on account of his age and because he be a father of the third generation and also on account of the kindness and most faithful conscientiousness which he have manifest toward him a he pursue the course of seleucus when brought before his master the latter be more angry at him than at those who have precede him and condemn him to endure the martyrdom of the savior on the cross a there lack yet one to fill up the number of the twelve martyr of whom we have spoken julian come to complete it he have just arrive from abroad and have not yet enter the gate of the city when have learn about the martyr while still on the way he rush at once just a he be to see them when he beheld the tabernacle of the saint prone on the ground be fill with joy he embrace and kiss them all the minister of slaughter straightway seize him a he be do this and lead him to firmilianus act a be his custom he condemn him to a slow fire thereupon julian leap and exult in a loud voice give thanks to the lord who have judged him worthy of such thing and be honor with the crown of martyrdom he be a cappadocian by birth and in his manner of life he be most circumspect faithful and sincere zealous in all other respect and animate by the holy spirit himself such be the company which be thought worthy to enter into martyrdom with pamphilus by the command of the impious governor their sacred and truly holy body be kept a food for the wild beast for four day and a many night but since strange to say through the providential care of god nothing approach them neither beast of prey nor bird nor dog they be take up uninjured and after suitable preparation be bury in the customary manner when the report of what have be do to these men be spread in all direction adrianus and eubulus have come from the socalled country of manganaean to caesarea to see the remain confessor be also ask at the gate the reason for their come and have acknowledge the truth be brought to firmilianus but he a be his custom without delay inflict many torture in their side and condemn them to be devour by wild beast after two day on the fifth of the month dystrus the third before the none of march which be regard a the birthday of the tutelary divinity of caesarea adrianus be thrown to a lion and afterwards slain with the sword but eubulus two day later on the none of march that be on the seventh of the month dystrus when the judge have earnestly entreat him to enjoy by sacrifice that which be consider freedom among them prefer a glorious death for religion to transitory life be make like the other an offering to wild beast and a the last of the martyr in caesarea seal the list of athlete it be proper also to relate here how in a short time the heavenly providence come upon the impious ruler together with the tyrant themselves for that very firmilianus who have thus abuse the martyr of christ after suffer with the others the severest punishment be put to death by the sword such be the martyrdom which take place at caesarea during the entire period of the persecution chapter i think it best to pas by all the other event which occur in the meantime such a those which happen to the bishop of the church when instead of shepherd of the rational flock of christ over which they preside in an unlawful manner the divine judgment consider them worthy of such a charge make them keeper of camel an irrational beast and very crooked in the structure of it body or condemn them to have the care of the imperial horse and i pas by also the insult and disgrace and torture they endure from the imperial overseer and ruler on account of the sacred vessel and treasure of the church and besides these the lust of power on the part of many the disorderly and unlawful ordination and the schism among the confessor themselves also the novelty which be zealously devise against the remnant of the church by the new and factious member who add innovation after innovation and force them in unsparingly among the calamity of the persecution heap misfortune upon misfortune i judge it more suitable to shun and avoid the account of these thing a i say at the begin but such thing a be sober and praiseworthy accord to the sacred word and if there be any virtue and praise i consider it most proper to tell and to record and to present to believe hearer in the history of the admirable martyr and after this i think it best to crown the entire work with an account of the peace which have appear unto u from heaven chapter the seventh year of our conflict be complete and the hostile measure which have continued into the eighth year be gradually and quietly become less severe a large number of confessor be collect at the copper mine in palestine and be act with considerable boldness so far a even to build place of worship but the ruler of the province a cruel and wicked man a his act against the martyr show have come there and learn the state of affair communicate it to the emperor write in accusation whatever he thought best thereupon be appoint superintendent of the mine he divide the band of confessor a if by a royal decree and sent some to dwell in cyprus and others in lebanon and he scatter others in different part of palestine and order them to labor in various work and select the four who seem to him to be the leader he sent them to the commander of the army in that section these be peleus and nilus egyptian bishop also a presbyter and patermuthius who be well know among them all for his zeal toward all the commander of the army demand of them a denial of religion and not obtain this he condemn them to death by fire there be others there who have be allot to dwell in a separate place by themselves such of the confessor a on account of age or mutilation or for other bodily infirmity have be release from service silvanus a bishop from gaza preside over them and set a worthy and genuine example of christianity this man have from the first day of the persecution and throughout it entire continuance be eminent for his confession in all sort of conflict have be kept all that time that he might so to speak set the final seal upon the whole conflict in palestine there be with him many from egypt among whom be john who surpass all in our time in the excellence of his memory he have formerly be deprive of his sight nevertheless on account of his eminence in confession he have with the others suffer the destruction of his foot by cauterization and although his sight have be destroyed he be subject to the same burning with fire the executioner aim after everything that be merciless and pitiless and cruel and inhuman since he be such a man one would not be so much astonish at his habit and his philosophic life nor would he seem so wonderful for them a for the strength of his memory for he have write whole book of the divine scripture not in table of stone a the divine apostle say neither on skin of animal nor on paper which moth and time destroy but truly in fleshy table of the heart in a transparent soul and most pure eye of the mind so that whenever he wish he could repeat a if from a treasury of word any portion of the scripture whether in the law or the prophet or the historical book or the gospel or the writing of the apostle i confess that i be astonish when i first saw the man a he be stand in the midst of a large congregation and repeat portion of the divine scripture while i only heard his voice i thought that accord to the custom in the meeting he be reading but when i come near and perceive what he be do and observe all the others stand around him with sound eye while he be use only the eye of his mind and yet be speak naturally like some prophet and far excel those who be sound in body it be impossible for me not to glorify god and wonder and i seem to see in these deed evident and strong confirmation of the fact that true manhood consists not in excellence of bodily appearance but in the soul and understand alone for he with his body mutilate manifest the superior excellence of the power that be within him but a to those whom we have mention a abide in a separate place and attend to their customary duty in fast and prayer and other exercise god himself saw fit to give them a salutary issue by extend his right hand in answer to them the bitter foe a they be arm against him zealously through their prayer to god could no longer endure them and determine to slay and destroy them from off the earth because they troubled him and god permit him to accomplish this that he might not be restrain from the wickedness he desire and that at the same time they might receive the prize of their manifold conflict therefore at the command of the most accurse maximinus forty lack one be behead in one day these martyrdom be accomplish in palestine during eight complete year and of this description be the persecution in our time begin with the demolition of the church it increase greatly a the ruler rise up from time to time against u in these assault the multiform and various conflict of those who wrestle in behalf of religion produce an innumerable multitude of martyr in every province in the region extend from libya and throughout all egypt and syria and from the east round about to the district of illyricum but the country beyond these all italy and sicily and gaul and the region toward the set sun in spain mauritania and africa suffer the war of persecution during less than two year and be deem worthy of a speedier divine visitation and peace the heavenly providence spar the singleness of purpose and faith of those men for what have never before be record in the annals of the roman government first take place in our day contrary to all expectation for during the persecution in our time the empire be divide into two part the brother dwell in the part of which we have just spoken enjoy peace but those in the other part endure trial without number but when the divine grace kindly and compassionately manifest it care for u too then truly our ruler also those very one through whom the war against u have be formerly carry on change their mind in a most wonderful manner and publish a recantation and by favorable edict and mild decree concern u extinguish the conflagration against u this recantation also must be record book chapter the pretend relaxation the imperial edict of recantation which have be quote above be post in all part of asia and in the adjoin province after this have be do maximinus the tyrant in the east a most impious man if there ever be one and most hostile to the religion of the god of the universe be by no mean satisfied with it content instead of send the abovequoted decree to the governor under him give them verbal command to relax the war against u for since he could not in any other way oppose the decision of his superior keep the law which have be already issue secret and take care that it might not be make know in the district under him he give an unwritten order to his governor that they should relax the persecution against u they communicate the command to each other in write sabinus at least who be honor with the high official rank among them communicate the will of the emperor to the provincial governor in a latin epistle the translation of which be a follow with continuous and most devote earnestness their majesty our most divine master the emperor formerly direct the mind of all men to follow the holy and correct course of life that those also who seem to live in a manner foreign to that of the roman should render the worship due to the immortal god but the obstinacy and most unconquerable determination of some go so far that they could neither be turn back from their purpose by the just reason of the command nor be intimidate by the impend punishment since therefore it have come to pas that by such conduct many have brought themselves into danger their majesty our most powerful master the emperor in the exalt nobility of piety esteem it foreign to their majesty purpose to bring men into so great danger for such a cause have command their devote servant myself to write to thy wisdom that if any christian be found engage in the worship of his own people thou shouldst abstain from molest and endanger him and shouldst not suppose it necessary to punish any one on this pretext for it have be prove by the experience of so long a time that they can in no way be persuade to abandon such obstinate conduct therefore it should be thy care to write to the curator and magistrate and district overseer of every city that they may know that it be not necessary for them to give far attention to this matter thereupon the ruler of the province think that the purpose of the thing which be write be truly make know to them declare the imperial will to the curator and magistrate and prefect of the various district in write but they do not limit themselves to write but sought more quickly to accomplish the suppose will of the emperor in deed also those whom they have imprison on account of their confession of the deity they set at liberty and they release those of them who have be sent to the mine for punishment for they erroneously suppose that this be the true will of the emperor and when these thing have thus be do immediately like a light shin forth in a dark night one could see in every city congregation gather and assembly throng and meeting held accord to their custom and every one of the unbelieving heathen be not a little astonish at these thing wonder at so marvelous a transformation and exclaim that the god of the christian be great and alone true and some of our people who have faithfully and bravely sustain the conflict of persecution again become frank and bold toward all but a many a have be diseased in the faith and have be shaken in their soul by the tempest strove eagerly for heal beseeching and implore the strong to stretch out to them a save hand and supplicate god to be merciful unto them then also the noble athlete of religion who have be set free from their suffering in the mine return to their own home happily and joyfully they pass through every city full of unspeakable pleasure and of a boldness which can not be express in word great crowd of men pursue their journey along the highway and through the marketplace praise god with hymn and psalm and you might have see those who a little while before have be driven in bond from their native country under a most cruel sentence return with bright and joyful face to their own fireside so that even they who have formerly thirst for our blood when they saw the unexpected wonder congratulate u on what have take place chapter the subsequent reverse but the tyrant who a we have say rule over the district of the orient a thorough hater of the good and an enemy of every virtuous person a he be could no longer bear this and indeed he do not permit matter to go on in this way quite six month devise all possible mean of destroy the peace he first attempt to restrain u under a pretext from meeting in the cemetery then through the agency of some wicked men he sent an embassy to himself against u incite the citizen of antioch to ask from him a a very great favor that he would by no mean permit any of the christian to dwell in their country and others be secretly induced to do the same thing the author of all this in antioch be theotecnus a violent and wicked man who be an impostor and whose character be foreign to his name he appear to have be the curator of the city chapter the newly erect statue at antioch after this man have carry on all kind of war against u and have cause our people to be diligently hunt up in their retreat a if they be unholy thief and have devise every sort of slander and accusation against u and become the cause of death to vast number he finally erect a statue of jupiter philius with certain jugglery and magic rite and after invent unholy form of initiation and illomened mystery in connection with it and abominable mean of purification he exhibit his jugglery by oracle which he pretend to utter even to the emperor and through a flattery which be please to the ruler he arouse the demon against the christian and say that the god have give command to expel the christian a his enemy beyond the confines of the city and the neighbor district chapter the memorial against u the fact that this man who take the lead in this matter have succeed in his purpose be an incitement to all the other official in the city under the same government to prepare a similar memorial and the governor of the province perceive that this be agreeable to the emperor suggest to their subject that they should do the same and a the tyrant by a rescript declare himself well pleased with their measure persecution be kindle anew against u priest for the image be then appoint in the city and besides them high priest by maximinus himself the latter be take from among those who be most distinguish in public life and have gain celebrity in all the office which they have fill and who be imbue moreover with great zeal for the service of those whom they worship indeed the extraordinary superstition of the emperor to speak in brief lead all his subject both ruler and private citizen for the sake of gratify him to do everything against u suppose that they could best show their gratitude to him for the benefit which they have receive from him by plot murder against u and exhibit toward u any new sign of malignity chapter the forge act have therefore forge act of pilate and our savior full of every kind of blasphemy against christ they sent them with the emperor approval to the whole of the empire subject to him with write command that they should be openly post to the view of all in every place both in country and city and that the schoolmaster should give them to their scholar instead of their customary lesson to be study and learn by heart while these thing be take place another military commander whom the roman call dux seize some infamous woman in the marketplace at damascus in phoenicia and by threaten to inflict torture upon them compel them to make a write declaration that they have once be christian and that they be acquaint with their impious deed that in their very church they commit licentious act and they uttered a many other slander against our religion a he wish them to have take down their word in write he communicate them to the emperor who command that these document also should be publish in every place and city chapter those who suffer martyrdom at this time not long afterward however this military commander become his own murderer and paid the penalty for his wickedness but we be oblige again to endure exile and severe persecution and the governor in every province be once more terribly stir up against u so that even some of those illustrious in the divine word be seize and have sentence of death pronounce upon them without mercy three of them in the city of emesa in phoenicia have confess that they be christian be thrown a food to the wild beast among them be a bishop silvanus a very old man who have fill his office full forty year at about the same time peter also who preside most illustriously over the parish in alexandria a divine example of a bishop on account of the excellence of his life and his study of the sacred scripture be seize for no cause and quite unexpectedly be a if by command of maximinus immediately and without explanation behead with him also many other bishop of egypt suffer the same fate and lucian a presbyter of the parish at antioch and a most excellent man in every respect temperate in life and famed for his learn in sacred thing be brought to the city of nicomedia where at that time the emperor happen to be stay and after deliver before the ruler an apology for the doctrine which he profess be commit to prison and put to death such trial be brought upon u in a brief time by maximinus the enemy of virtue so that this persecution which be stir up against u seem far more cruel than the former chapter the decree against u which be engrave on pillar the memorial against u and copy of the imperial edict issue in reply to them be engrave and set up on brazen pillar in the midst of the city a course which have never be follow elsewhere the child in the school have daily in their mouth the name of jesus and pilate and the act which have be forge in wanton insolence it appear to me necessary to insert here this document of maximinus which be post on pillar in order that there may be make manifest at the same time the boastful and haughty arrogance of the godhating man and the sleepless evilhating divine vengeance upon the impious which follow close upon him and under whose pressure he not long afterward take the opposite course in respect to u and confirm it by write law the rescript be in the follow word copy of a translation of the rescript of maximinus in answer to the memorial against u take from the pillar in tyre now at length the feeble power of the human mind have become able to shake off and to scatter every dark mist of error which before this besiege the sens of men who be more miserable than impious and envelop them in dark and destructive ignorance and to perceive that it be govern and establish by the beneficent providence of the immortal god it pass belief how grateful how please and how agreeable it be to u that you have give a most decide proof of your pious resolution for even before this it be know to every one how much regard and reverence you be pay to the immortal god exhibit not a faith of bare and empty word but continued and wonderful example of illustrious deed wherefore your city may justly be call a seat and dwell of the immortal god at least it appear by many sign that it flourish because of the presence of the celestial god behold therefore your city regardless of all private advantage and omit it former petition in it own behalf when it perceive that the adherent of that execrable vanity be again begin to spread and to start the great conflagration like a neglect and extinguish funeral pile when it brand be rekindle immediately resort to our piety a to a metropolis of all religiousness ask some remedy and aid it be evident that the god have give you this save mind on account of your faith and piety accordingly that supreme and mighty jove who presides over your illustrious city who preserve your ancestral god your wife and child your hearth and home from every destructive pest have infuse into your soul this wholesome resolve show and prove how excellent and glorious and salutary it be to observe with the become reverence the worship and sacred rite of the immortal god for who can be found so ignorant or so devoid of all understand a not to perceive that it be due to the kindly care of the god that the earth do not refuse the seed sown in it nor disappoint the hope of the husbandman with vain expectation that impious war be not inevitably fix upon earth and waste body drag down to death under the influence of a corrupt atmosphere that the sea be not swollen and raise on high by blast of intemperate wind that unexpected hurricane do not burst forth and stir up the destructive tempest moreover that the earth the nourisher and mother of all be not shaken from it low depth with a terrible tremor and that the mountain upon it do not sink into the opening chasm no one be ignorant that all these and evil still bad than these have oftentimes happen hitherto and all these misfortune have take place on account of the destructive error of the empty vanity of those impious men when it prevail in their soul and we may almost say weigh down the whole world with shame after other word he add let them look at the stand crop already flourish with wave head in the broad field and at the meadow glitter with plant and flower in response to abundant rain and the restore mildness and softness of the atmosphere finally let all rejoice that the might of the most powerful and terrible mar have be propitiate by our piety our sacrifice and our veneration and let them on this account enjoy firm and tranquil peace and quiet and let a many a have wholly abandon that blind error and delusion and have return to a right and sound mind rejoice the more a those who have be rescue from an unexpected storm or severe disease and be to reap the fruit of i pleasure for the rest of their life but if they still persist in their execrable vanity let them a you have desire be driven far away from your city and territory that thus in accordance with your praiseworthy zeal in this matter your city be freed from every pollution and impiety may accord to it native disposition attend to the sacred rite of the immortal god with become reverence but that ye may know how acceptable to u your request respect this matter have be and how ready our mind be to confer benefit voluntarily without memorial and petition we permit your devotion to ask whatever great gift ye may desire in return for this your pious disposition and now ask that this may be do and that ye may receive it for ye shall obtain it without delay this be grant to your city shall furnish for all time an evidence of reverent piety toward the immortal god and of the fact that you have obtain from our benevolence merit prize for this choice of yours and it shall be show to your child and childrens child this be publish against u in all the province deprive u of every hope of good at least from men so that accord to that divine utterance if it be possible even the elect would have stumble at these thing and now indeed when the hope of most of u be almost extinct suddenly while those who be to execute against u the above decree have in some place scarcely finish their journey god the defender of his own church exhibit his heavenly interposition in our behalf wellnigh stop the tyrant boasting against u chapter the misfortune which happen in connection with these thing in famine pestilence and war the customary rain and shower of the winter season cease to fall in their wonted abundance upon the earth and an unexpected famine make it appearance and in addition to this a pestilence and another severe disease consist of an ulcer which on account of it fiery appearance be appropriately call a carbuncle this spread over the whole body greatly endanger the life of those who suffer from it but a it chiefly attack the eye it deprive multitude of men woman and child of their sight in addition to this the tyrant be compel to go to war with the armenian who have be from ancient time friend and ally of the roman a they be also christian and zealous in their piety toward the deity the enemy of god have attempt to compel them to sacrifice to idol and demon and have thus make friend foe and ally enemy all these thing suddenly take place at one and the same time and refute the tyrant empty vaunt against the deity for he have boast that because of his zeal for idol and his hostility against u neither famine nor pestilence nor war have happen in his time these thing therefore come upon him at once and together furnish a prelude also of his own destruction he himself with his force be defeat in the war with the armenian and the rest of the inhabitant of the city under him be terribly afflict with famine and pestilence so that one measure of wheat be sell for twentyfive hundred attic drachma those who die in the city be innumerable and those who die in the country and village be still more so that the tax list which formerly include a great rural population be almost entirely wipe out nearly all be speedily destroyed by famine and pestilence some therefore desire to dispose of their most precious thing to those who be well supply in return for the small morsel of food and others sell their possession little by little fell into the last extremity of want some chew wisp of hay and recklessly eat noxious herb undermined and mine their constitution and some of the highborn woman in the city driven by want to shameful extremity go forth into the marketplace to beg give evidence of their former liberal culture by the modesty of their appearance and the decency of their apparel some waste away like ghost and at the very point of death stumble and totter here and there and too weak to stand fell down in the middle of the street lie stretch out at full length they beg that a small morsel of food might be give them and with their last gasp they cry out hunger have strength only for this most painful cry but others who seem to be well supply astonish at the multitude of the beggar after give away large quantity finally become hard and relentless expect that they themselves also would soon suffer the same calamity a those who beg so that in the midst of the marketplace and lane dead and naked body lay unburied for many day present the most lamentable spectacle to those that beheld them some also become food for dog on which account the survivor begin to kill the dog l they should become mad and should go to devour men but still bad be the pestilence which consume entire house and family and especially those whom the famine be not able to destroy because of their abundance of food thus men of wealth ruler and governor and multitude in office a if left by the famine on purpose for the pestilence suffer swift and speedy death every place therefore be full of lamentation in every lane and marketplace and street there be nothing else to be see or heard than tear with the customary instrument and the voice of the mourner in this way death wag war with these two weapon pestilence and famine destroyed whole family in a short time so that one could see two or three dead body carry out at once such be the reward of the boasting of maximinus and of the measure of the city against u then do the evidence of the universal zeal and piety of the christian become manifest to all the heathen for they alone in the midst of such ill show their sympathy and humanity by their deed every day some continued care for and bury the dead for there be multitude who have no one to care for them others collect in one place those who be afflict by the famine throughout the entire city and give bread to them all so that the thing become noise abroad among all men and they glorify the god of the christian and convince by the fact themselves confess that they alone be truly pious and religious after these thing be thus do god the great and celestial defender of the christian have reveal in the event which have be described his anger and indignation at all men for the great evil which they have brought upon u restore to u the bright and gracious sunlight of his providence in our behalf so that in the deepest darkness a light of peace shone most wonderfully upon u from him and make it manifest to all that god himself have always be the ruler of our affair from time to time indeed he chastens his people and corrects them by his visitation but again after sufficient chastisement he show mercy and favor to those who hope in him chapter the victory of the godbeloved emperor thus when constantine whom we have already mention a an emperor born of an emperor a pious son of a most pious and prudent father and licinius second to him two godbeloved emperor honor alike for their intelligence and their piety be stir up against the two most impious tyrant by god the absolute ruler and savior of all engage in formal war against them with god a their ally maxentius be defeat at rome by constantine in a remarkable manner and the tyrant of the east do not long survive him but met a most shameful death at the hand of licinius who have not yet become insane constantine who be the superior both in dignity and imperial rank first take compassion upon those who be oppress at rome and have invoked in prayer the god of heaven and his word and jesus christ himself the savior of all a his aid advanced with his whole army propose to restore to the roman their ancestral liberty but maxentius put confidence rather in the art of sorcery than in the devotion of his subject do not dare to go forth beyond the gate of the city but fortify every place and district and town which be enslave by him in the neighborhood of rome and in all italy with an immense multitude of troop and with innumerable band of soldier but the emperor rely upon the assistance of god attack the first second and third army of the tyrant and conquer them all and have advanced through the great part of italy be already very near rome then that he might not be compel to wage war with the roman for the sake of the tyrant god himself drew the latter a if bound in chain some distance without the gate and confirm those threat against the impious which have be anciently inscribed in sacred book disbelieve indeed by most a a myth but believe by the faithful confirm them in a word by the deed itself to all both believer and unbeliever that saw the wonder with their eye thus a in the time of moses himself and of the ancient godbeloved race of hebrew he cast pharaoh chariot and host into the sea and overwhelmed his chosen charioteer in the red sea and cover them with the flood in the same way maxentius also with his soldier and bodyguard go down into the depth like a stone when he flee before the power of god which be with constantine and pass through the river which lay in his way over which he have form a bridge with boat and thus prepared the mean of his own destruction in regard to him one might say he digged a pit and open it and fell into the hole which he have make his labor shall turn upon his own head and his unrighteousness shall fall upon his own crown thus then the bridge over the river be broken the passageway settle down and immediately the boat with the men disappear in the depth and that most impious one himself first of all then the shieldbearers who be with him a the divine oracle foretold sank like lead in the mighty water so that those who obtain the victory from god if not in word at least in deed like moses the great servant of god and those who be with him fittingly sang a they have sung against the impious tyrant of old say let u sing unto the lord for he hath gloriously glorify himself horse and rider hath he thrown into the sea a helper and a protector hath he become for my salvation and who be like unto thee o lord among the god who be like unto thee glorious in holiness marvelous in glory do wonder these and the like praise constantine by his very deed sang to god the universal ruler and author of his victory a he enter rome in triumph immediately all the member of the senate and the other most celebrate men with the whole roman people together with child and woman receive him a their deliverer their savior and their benefactor with shin eye and with their whole soul with shout of gladness and unbounded joy but he a one possess of inborn piety toward god do not exult in the shout nor be he elate by the praise but perceive that his aid be from god he immediately command that a trophy of the savior passion be put in the hand of his own statue and when he have place it with the save sign of the cross in it right hand in the most public place in rome he command that the follow inscription should be engrave upon it in the roman tongue by this salutary sign the true proof of bravery i have save and freed your city from the yoke of the tyrant and moreover have set at liberty both the senate and the people of rome i have restore them to their ancient distinction and splendor and after this both constantine himself and with him the emperor licinius who have not yet be seize by that madness into which he later fell praise god a the author of all their blessing with one will and mind drew up a full and most complete decree in behalf of the christian and sent an account of the wonderful thing do for them by god and of the victory over the tyrant together with a copy of the decree itself to maximinus who still rule over the nation of the east and pretend friendship toward them but he like a tyrant be greatly pain by what he learn but not wish to seem to yield to others nor on the other hand to suppress that which be command for fear of those who enjoin it a if on his own authority he address under compulsion to the governor under him this first communication in behalf of the christian falsely invent thing against himself which have never be do by him copy of a translation of the epistle of the tyrant maximinus jovius maximinus augustus to sabinus i be confident that it be manifest both to thy firmness and to all men that our master diocletian and maximianus our father when they saw almost all men abandon the worship of the god and attach themselves to the party of the christian rightly decreed that all who give up the worship of those same immortal god should be recall by open chastisement and punishment to the worship of the god but when i first come to the east under favorable auspex and learn that in some place a great many men who be able to render public service have be banish by the judge for the abovementioned cause i give command to each of the judge that henceforth none of them should treat the provincial with severity but that they should rather recall them to the worship of the god by flattery and exhortation then when in accordance with my command these order be obeyed by the judge it come to pas that none of those who live in the district of the east be banish or insult but that they be rather brought back to the worship of the god by the fact that no severity be employ toward them but afterwards when i go up last year under good auspex to nicomedia and sojourn there citizen of the same city come to me with the image of the god earnestly entreat that such a people should by no mean be permit to dwell in their country but when i learn that many men of the same religion dwelt in those region i reply that i gladly thanked them for their request but that i perceive that it be not proffer by all and that if therefore there be any that persevere in the same superstition each one have the privilege of do a he pleased even if he wish to recognize the worship of the god nevertheless i consider it necessary to give a friendly answer to the inhabitant of nicomedia and to the other city which have so earnestly present to me the same petition namely that no christian should dwell in their city both because this same course have be pursue by all the ancient emperor and also because it be please to the god through whom all men and the government of the state itself endure and to confirm the request which they present in behalf of the worship of their deity therefore although before this time special letter have be sent to thy devotedness and command have likewise be give that no harsh measure should be take against those provincial who desire to follow such a course but that they should be treat mildly and moderately nevertheless in order that they may not suffer insult or extortion from the beneficiary or from any others i have thought meet to remind thy firmness in this epistle also that thou shouldst lead our provincial rather by flattery and exhortation to recognize the care of the god hence if any one of his own choice should decide to adopt the worship of the god it be fitting that he should be welcome but if any should wish to follow their own religion do thou leave it in their power wherefore it behooves thy devotedness to observe that which be commit to thee and to see that power be give to no one to oppress our provincial with insult and extortion since a already write it be fitting to recall our provincial to the worship of the god rather by exhortation and flattery but in order that this command of ours may come to the knowledge of all our provincial it be incumbent upon thee to proclaim that which have be enjoin in an edict issue by thyself since he be force to do this by necessity and do not give the command by his own will he be not regard by any one a sincere or trustworthy because he have already show his unstable and deceitful disposition after his former similar concession none of our people therefore venture to hold meeting or even to appear in public because his communication do not cover this but only command to guard against do u any injury and do not give order that we should hold meeting or build church or perform any of our customary act and yet constantine and licinius the advocate of peace and piety have write him to permit this and have grant it to all their subject by edict and ordinance but this most impious man do not choose to yield in this matter until be driven by the divine judgment he be at last compel to do it against his will chapter theoverthrow of the tyrant and the word which they uttered before their death the circumstance which drove him to this course be the follow be no longer able to sustain the magnitude of the government which have be undeservedly commit to him in consequence of his want of prudence and imperial understand he manage affair in a base manner and with his mind unreasonably exalt in all thing with boastful pride even toward his colleague in the empire who be in every respect his superior in birth in training in education in worth and intelligence and great of all in temperance and piety toward the true god he begin to venture to act audaciously and to arrogate to himself the first rank become mad in his folly he broke the treaty which he have make with licinius and undertook an implacable war then in a brief time he threw all thing into confusion and stir up every city and have collect his entire force comprise an immense number of soldier he go forth to battle with him elate by his hope in demon whom he suppose to be god and by the number of his soldier and when he join battle he be deprive of the oversight of god and the victory be give to licinius who be then ruling by the one and only god of all first the army in which he trust be destroyed and a all his guard abandon him and left him alone and flee to the victor he secretly divest himself a quickly a possible of the imperial garment which do not fitly belong to him and in a cowardly and ignoble and unmanly way mingle with the crowd and then flee conceal himself in field and village but though he be so careful for his safety he scarcely escape the hand of his enemy reveal by his deed that the divine oracle be faithful and true in which it be say a king be not save by a great force and a giant shall not be save by the greatness of his strength a horse be a vain thing for safety nor shall he be deliver by the greatness of his power behold the eye of the lord be upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy to deliver their soul from death thus the tyrant cover with shame go to his own country and first in frantic rage he slew many priest and prophet of the god whom he have formerly admire and whose oracle have incite him to undertake the war a sorcerer and impostor and besides all a betrayer of his safety then have give glory to the god of the christian and enact a most full and complete ordinance in behalf of their liberty he be immediately seize with a mortal disease and no respite be grant him depart this life the law enact by him be a follow copy of the edict of the tyrant in behalf of the christian translate from the man tongue the emperor caesar caius valerius maximinus germanicus sarmaticus plus felix invictus augustus we believe it manifest that no one be ignorant but that every man who look back over the past know and be conscious that m every way we care continually for the good of our provincial and wish to furnish them with those thing which be of especial advantage to all and for the common benefit and profit and whatever contributes to the public welfare and be agreeable to the view of each when therefore before this it become clear to our mind that under pretext of the command of our parent the most divine diocletian and maximianus which enjoin that the meeting of the christian should be abolish many extortion and spoliation have be practice by official and that those evil be continually increase to the detriment of our provincial toward whom we be especially anxious to exercise proper care and that their possession be in consequence perish letter be sent last year to the governor of each province in which we decreed that if any one wish to follow such a practice or to observe this same religion he should be permit without hindrance to pursue his purpose and should be impede and prevent by no one and that all should have liberty to do without any fear or suspicion that which each prefer but even now we can not help perceive that some of the judge have mistaken our command and have give our people reason to doubt the meaning of our ordinance and have cause them to proceed too reluctantly to the observance of those religious rite which be please to them in order therefore that in the future every suspicion of fearful doubt may be take away we have command that this decree be publish so that it may be clear to all that whoever wish to embrace this sect and religion be permit to do so by virtue of this grant of ours and that each one a he wish or a be please to him be permit to practice this religion which he have chosen to observe accord to his custom it be also grant them to build lord house but that this grant of ours may be the great we have thought good to decree also that if any house and land before this time rightfully belong to the christian and by the command of our parent fell into the treasury or be confiscate by any city whether they have be sell or present to any one a a gift that all these should be restore to their original possessor the christian in order that in this also every one may have knowledge of our piety and care these be the word of the tyrant which be publish not quite a year after the decree against the christian engrave by him on pillar and by him to whom a little before we seem impious wretch and atheist and destroyer of all life so that we be not permit to dwell in any city nor even in country or desert by him decree and ordinance be issue in behalf of the christian and they who recently have be destroyed by fire and sword by wild beast and bird of prey in the presence of the tyrant himself and have suffer every specie of torture and punishment and most miserable death a atheist and impious wretch be now acknowledge by him a possessor of religion and be permit to build church and the tyrant himself bore witness and confess that they have some right and have make such confession a if he have receive some benefit on account of them he suffer perhaps less than he ought to have suffer and be smitten by a sudden scourge of god he perish in the second campaign of the war but his end be not like that of military chieftain who while fight bravely in battle for virtue and friend often boldly encounter a glorious death for like an impious enemy of god while his army be still drawn up in the field remain at home and conceal himself he suffer the punishment which he deserve for he be smitten with a sudden scourge of god in his whole body and harass by terrible pain and torment he fell prostrate on the ground waste by hunger while all his flesh be dissolve by an invisible and godsent fire so that the whole appearance of his frame be change and there be left only a kind of image waste away by length of time to a skeleton of dry bone so that those who be present could think of his body a nothing else than the tomb of his soul which be bury in a body already dead and completely melt away and a the heat still more violently consume him in the depth of his marrow his eye burst forth and fall from their socket left him blind thereupon still breathing and make free confession to the lord he invoked death and at last after acknowledge that he justly suffer these thing on account of his violence against christ he give up the ghost chapter the final destruction of the enemy of religion thus when maximinus who alone have remain of the enemy of religion and have appear the bad of them all be put out of the way the renovation of the church from their foundation be begin by the grace of god the ruler of all and the word of christ shin unto the glory of the god of the universe obtain great freedom than before while the impious enemy of religion be cover with extremest shame and dishonor for maximinus himself be first pronounce by the emperor a common enemy be declare by public proclamation to be a most impious execrable and godhating tyrant and of the portrait which have be set up in every city in honor of him or of his child some be thrown down from their place to the ground and torn in piece while the face of others be obliterate by daub them with black paint and the statue which have be erect to his honor be likewise overthrown and broken and lay expose to the laughter and sport of those who wish to insult and abuse them then also all the honor of the other enemy of religion be take away and all those who side with maximinus be slain especially those who have be honor by him with high office in reward for their flattery and have behave insolently toward our doctrine such an one be peucetius the dearest of his companion who have be honor and reward by him above all who have be consul a second and third time and have be appoint by him chief minister and culcianus who have likewise advanced through every grade of office and be also celebrate for his numberless execution of christian in egypt and besides these not a few others by whose agency especially the tyranny of maximinus have be confirm and extend and theotecnus also be summon by justice which by no mean overlook his deed against the christian for when the statue have be set up by him at antioch he appear to be in the happiest state and be already make a governor by maximinus but licinius come down to the city of antioch make a search for impostor and torture the prophet and priest of the newly erect statue ask them for what reason they practice their deception they under the stress of torture be unable longer to conceal the matter and declare that the whole deceptive mystery have be devise by the art of theotecnus therefore after meting out to all of them just judgment he first put theotecnus himself to death and then his confederate in the imposture with the severest possible torture to all these be add also the child of maximinus whom he have already make sharer in the imperial dignity by place their name on tablet and statue and the relative of the tyrant who before have be boastful and have in their pride oppress all men suffer the same punishment with those who have be already mention a well a the extremest disgrace for they have not receive instruction neither do they know and understand the exhortation give in the holy word put not your trust in prince nor in the son of men in whom there be no salvation his spirit shall go forth and return to his earth in that day all their thought perish the impious one have be thus remove the government be preserve firm and

the sake of save them that be ill examines their suffering handle their foul sore and reaps pain for himself from the misery of another so u who be not only diseased and afflict with terrible ulcer and wound already mortify but be even lie among the dead he hath save for himself from the very jaw of death for none other of those in heaven have such power a without harm to minister to the salvation of so many but he alone have reach our deep corruption he alone have take upon himself our labor he alone have suffer the punishment due for our impiety have recover u who be not half dead

be melt but when malignant envy and the evil love demon wellnigh burst with anger at such grace and kindness and turn against u all his deathdealing force and when at first like a dog go mad which gnashes his teeth at the stone thrown at him and pours out his rage against his assailant upon the inanimate missile he level his ferocious madness at the stone of the sanctuary and at the lifeless material of the house and desolate the church at least a he suppose and then emit terrible hissing and snakelike sound now by the threat of impious tyrant and again by the blasphemous edict of profane ruler vomit forth death moreover and infect with his deleterious and souldestroying poison the soul capture by him and almost slay them by his deathfraught sacrifice of dead idol and cause every beast in the form of man and every kind of savage to assault u then indeed the angel of the great council the great captain of god after the mighty soldier of his kingdom have displayed sufficient exercise through patience and endurance in everything suddenly appear anew and blot out and annihilate his enemy and foe so that they seem never to have have even a name but his friend and relative he raise to the high glory in the presence not only of all men but also of celestial power of sun and moon and star and of the whole heaven and earth so that now a have never happen before the supreme ruler conscious of the honor which they have receive from him spit upon the face of dead idol trample upon the unhallowed rite of demon make sport of the ancient delusion hand down from their father and acknowledge only one god the common benefactor of all themselves include and they confess christ the son of god universal king of all and proclaim him savior on monument imperishably record in imperial letter in the midst of the city which rule over the earth his righteous deed and his victory over the impious thus jesus christ our savior be the only one from all eternity who have be acknowledge even by those high in the earth not a a common king among men but a a trite son of the universal god and who have be worship a very god and that rightly for what king that ever live attain such virtue a to fill the ear and tongue of all men upon earth with his own name what king after ordain such pious and wise law have extend them from one end of the earth to the other so that they be perpetually read in the hearing of all men who have abrogate barbarous and savage custom of uncivilized nation by his gentle and most philanthropic law who be attack for entire age by all have show such superhuman virtue a to flourish daily and remain young throughout his life who have found a nation which of old be not even heard of but which now be not conceal in some comer of the earth but be spread abroad everywhere under the sun who have so fortify his soldier with the arm of piety that their soul be firmer than adamant shine brilliantly in the contest with their opponent what king prevails to such an extent and even after death lead on his soldier and set up trophy over his enemy and fill every place country and city greek and barbarian with his royal dwelling even divine temple with their consecrate oblation like this very temple with it superb adornment and votive offering which be themselves so truly great and majestic worthy of wonder and admiration and clear sign of the sovereignty of our savior for now too he spake and they be make he command and they be create for what be there to resist the nod of the universal king and governor and word of god himself a special discourse would be need accurately to survey and explain all this and also to describe how great the zeal of the laborer be regard by him who be celebrate a divine who look upon the living temple which we all constitute and survey the house compose of living and move stone which be well and surely built upon the foundation of the apostle and prophet the chief cornerstone be jesus christ himself who have be reject not only by the builder of that ancient building which no longer stand but also by the builder evil architect of evil work of the structure which be compose of the mass of men and still endures but the father have approve him both then and now and have make him the head of the corner of this our common church who that beholds this living temple of the living god form of ourselves this great and truly divine sanctuary i say whose inmost shrine be invisible to the multitude and be truly holy and a holy of holy would venture to declare it who be able even to look within the sacred enclosure except the great high priest of all to whom alone it be permit to fathom the mystery of every rational soul but perhaps it be grant to another to one only to be second after him in the same work namely to the commander of this army whom the first and great high priest himself have honor with the second place in this sanctuary the shepherd of your divine flock who have obtain your people by the allotment and the judgment of the father a if he have appoint him his own servant and interpreter a new aaron or melchizedec make like the son of god remain and continually preserve by him in accordance with the united prayer of all of you to him therefore alone let it be grant if not in the first place at least in the second after the first and great high priest to observe and supervise the inmost state of your soul to him who by experience and length of time have accurately prove each one and who by his zeal and care have dispose you all in pious conduct and doctrine and be well able than any one else to give an account adequate to the fact of those thing which he himself have accomplish with the divine assistance a to our first and great high priest it be say whatsoever he seeth the father do those thing likewise the son also doeth so also this one look up to him a to the first teacher with pure eye of the mind use a archetype whatsoever thing he seeth him do produceth image of them make them so far a be possible in the same likeness in nothing inferior to that beseleel whom god himself fill with the spirit of wisdom and understand and with other technical and scientific knowledge and call to be the maker of the temple construct after heavenly type give in symbol thus this one also bearing in his own soul the image of the whole christ the word the wisdom the light have form this magnificent temple of the high god correspond to the pattern of the great a a visible to an invisible it be impossible to say with what greatness of soul with what wealth and liberality of mind and with what emulation on the part of all of you show in the magnanimity of the contributor who have ambitiously striven in no way to be left behind by him in the execution of the same purpose and this place for this deserves to be mention first of all which have be cover with all sort of rubbish by the artifice of our enemy he do not overlook nor do he yield to the wickedness of those who have brought about that condition of thing although he might have chosen some other place for many other site be available in the city where he would have have less labor and be free from trouble but have first arouse himself to the work and then strengthen the whole people with zeal and form them all into one great body he fought the first contest for he thought that this church which have be especially besiege by the enemy which have first suffer and endure the same persecution with u and for u like a mother bereft of her child should rejoice with u in the signal favor of the allmerciful god for when the great shepherd have driven away the wild animal and wolf and every cruel and savage beast and a the divine oracle say have broken the jaw of the lion he thought good to collect again her child in the same place and in the most righteous manner he set up the fold of her flock to put to shame the enemy and avenger and to refute the impious dare of the enemy of god and now they be not the hater of god for they never be after they have troubled and be troubled for a little time they suffer the fitting punishment and brought themselves and their friend and their relative to total destruction so that the declaration inscribed of old in sacred record have be prove true by fact in these declaration the divine word truly say among other thing the follow concern them the wicked have drawn out the sword they have bent their bow to slay the righteous in heart let their sword enter into their own heart and their bow be broken and again their memorial be perish with a sound and their name hast thou blot out forever and ever for when they also be in trouble they cry out and there be none to save unto the lord and he heard them not but their foot be bound together and they fell but we have arisen and stand upright and that which be announce beforehand in these word o lord in thy city thou shalt set at naught their image have be show to be true to the eye of all but have wag war like the giant against god they die in this way but she that be desolate and reject by men receive the consummation which we behold in consequence of her patience toward god so that the prophecy of isaiah be spoken of her rejoice thirsty desert let the desert rejoice and blossom a the lily and the desert place shall blossom and be glad be strengthen ye weak hand and feeble knee be of good courage ye feeblehearted in your mind be strong fear not behold our god recompenseth judgment and will recompense he will come and save u for he say in the wilderness water have broken out and a pool in thirsty ground and the dry land shall be water meadow and in the thirsty ground there shall be spring of water these thing which be prophesy long ago have be record in sacred book but no longer be they transmit to u by hearsay merely but in fact this desert this dry land this widowed and desert one whose gate they cut down with ax like wood in a forest whom they broke down with hatchet and hammer whose book also they destroyed burning with fire the sanctuary of god and profane unto the ground the habitation of his name whom all that pass by upon the way plucked and whose fence they broke down whom the boar out of the wood ravage and on which the savage wild beast fed now by the wonderful power of christ when he will it have become like a lily for at that time also she be chasten at his nod a by a careful father for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth then after be chasten in a measure accord to the necessity of the case she be command to rejoice anew and she blossom a a lily and exhales her divine odor among all men for it be say water hath broken out in the wilderness the fountain of the save bath of divine regeneration and now she who a little before be a desert have become water meadow and spring of water have gush forth in a thirsty land the hand which before be weak have become truly strong and these work be great and convincing proof of strong hand the knee also which before be feeble and infirm recover their wonted strength be move straight forward in the path of divine knowledge and hasten to the kindred flock of the allgracious shepherd and if there be any whose soul have be stupefy by the threat of the tyrant not even they be pass by a incurable by the save word but he heals them also and urge them on to receive divine comfort say be ye comfort ye who be fainthearted be ye strengthen fear not this our new and excellent zerubabel have heard the word which announce beforehand that she who have be make a desert on account of god should enjoy these thing after the bitter captivity and the abomination of desolation do not overlook the dead body but first of all with prayer and supplication propitiate the father with the common consent of all of you and invoke the only one that giveth life to the dead a his ally and fellowworker raise her that be fall after purify and free her from her ill and he clothed her not with the ancient garment but with such an one a he have again learn from the sacred oracle which say clearly and the latter glory of this house shall be great than the former thus enclose a much large space he fortify the outer court with a wall surround the whole which should serve a a most secure bulwark for the entire edifice and he raise and spread out a great and lofty vestibule toward the ray of the rise sun and furnish those stand far without the sacred enclosure a full view of those within almost turn the eye of those who be stranger to the faith to the entrance so that no one could pas by without be impressed by the memory of the former desolation and of the present incredible transformation his hope be that such an one be impressed by this might be attract and be induced to enter by the very sight but when one come within the gate he do not permit him to enter the sanctuary immediately with impure and unwashed foot but leave a large a space a possible between the temple and the outer entrance he have surround and adorn it with four transverse cloister make a quadrangular space with pillar rise on every side which he have join with latticework screen of wood rise to a suitable height and he have left an open space in the middle so that the sky can be see and the free air bright in the ray of the sun here he have place symbol of sacred purification set up fountain opposite the temple which furnish an abundance of water wherewith those who come within the sanctuary may purify themselves this be the first haltingplace of those who enter and it furnishes at the same time a beautiful and splendid scene to every one and to those who still need elementary instruction a fitting station but passing by this spectacle he have make open entrance to the temple with many other vestibule within place three door on one side likewise face the ray of the sun the one in the middle adorn with plate of bronze iron bound and beautifully emboss he have make much high and broader than the others a if he be make them guard for it a for a queen in the same way arrange the number of vestibule for the corridor on each side of the whole temple he have make above them various opening into the building for the purpose of admit more light adorn them with very fine woodcarving but the royal house he have furnish with more beautiful and splendid material use unstinted liberality in his disbursement it seem to me superfluous to describe here in detail the length and breadth of the building it splendor and it majesty surpass description and the brilliant appearance of the work it lofty pinnacle reach to the heaven and the costly cedar of lebanon above them which the divine oracle have not omit to mention say the tree of the lord shall rejoice and the cedar of lebanon which he hath plant why need i now describe the skillful architectural arrangement and the surpass beauty of each part when the testimony of the eye render instruction through the ear superfluous for when he have thus complete the temple he provide it with lofty throne in honor of those who preside and in addition with seat arrange in proper order throughout the whole building and finally place in the middle the holy of holy the altar and that it might be inaccessible to the multitude enclose it with wooden latticework accurately wrought with artistic carve present a wonderful sight to the beholder and not even the pavement be neglect by him for this too he adorn with beautiful marble of every variety then finally he pass on to the part without the temple provide spacious exedrae and building on each side which be join to the basilica and communicate with the entrance to the interior of the structure these be erect by our most peaceful solomon the maker of the temple of god for those who still need purification and sprinkle by water and the holy spirit so that the prophecy quote above be no longer a word merely but a fact for now it have also come to pas that in truth the biter glory of this house be great than the former for it be necessary and fitting that a her shepherd and lord have once taste death for her and after his suffer have change that vile body which he assume in her behalf into a splendid and glorious body lead the very flesh which have be deliver from corruption to incorruption she too should enjoy the dispensation of the savior for have receive from him the promise of much great thing than these she desire to share uninterruptedly throughout eternity with the choir of the angel of light in the far great glory of regeneration in the resurrection of an incorruptible body in the palace of god beyond the heaven with christ jesus himself the universal benefactor and savior but for the present she that be formerly widowed and desolate be clothed by the grace of god with these flower and be become truly like a lily a the prophecy say and have receive the bridal garment and the crown of beauty she be taught by isaiah to dance and to present her thankofferings unto god the king in reverent word let u hear her say my soul shall rejoice in the lord for he hath clothed me with a garment of salvation and with a robe of gladness he hath bedeck me like a bridegroom with a garland and he hath adorn me like a bride with jewel and like the earth which bringeth forth her bud and like a garden which causeth the thing that be sown in it to spring forth thus the lord god hath cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nation in these word she exults and in similar word the heavenly bridegroom the word jesus christ himself answer her hear the lord say fear not because thou hast be put to shame neither be thou confound because thou hast be rebuke for thou shalt forget the former shame and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more not a a woman desert and fainthearted i hath the lord call thee nor a a woman hat from her youth saith thy god for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercy will i have mercy upon thee in a little wrath i hid my face from thee but with everlasting mercy will i have mercy upon thee saith the lord that hath redeem thee awake awake thou who hast drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of his fury for thou hast drunk the cup of ruin the vessel of my wrath and hast drain it and there be none to console thee of all thy son whom thou didst bring forth and there be none to take thee by the hand behold i have take out of thine hand the cup of ruin the vessel of my fury and thou shalt no longer drink it and i will put it into the hand of them that have treat thee unjustly and have humble thee awake awake put on thy strength put on thy glory shake off the dust and arise sit thee down loose the band of thy neck lift up thine eye round about and behold thy child gather together behold they be gather together and be come to thee a i live saith the lord thou shalt clothe thee with them all a with an ornament and gird thyself with them a with the ornament of a bride for thy waste and corrupt and ruin place shall now be too narrow by reason of those that inhabit thee and they that swallow thee up shall be far from thee for thy son whom thou hast lose shall say in thine ear the place be too narrow for me give place to me that i may dwell then shalt thou say in thine heart who hath begotten me these i be childless and a widow and who hath brought up these for me i be left alone and these where be they for me these be the thing which isaiah foretold and which be anciently record concern u in sacred book s and it be necessary that we should sometime learn their truthfulness by their fulfillment for when the bridegroom the word address such language to his own bride the sacred and holy church this bridesman when she be desolate and lie like a corpse bereft of hope in the eye of men in accordance with the united prayer of all of you a be proper stretch out your hand and arouse and raise her up at the command of god the universal king and at the manifestation of the power of jesus christ and have raise her he establish her a he have learn from the description give in the sacred oracle this be indeed a very great wonder passing all admiration especially to those who attend only to the outward appearance but more wonderful than wonder be the archetype and their mental prototype and divine model i mean the reproduction of the inspire and rational building in our soul this the divine son himself create after his own image impart to it everywhere and in all respect the likeness of god an incorruptible nature incorporeal rational free from all earthly matter a be endow with it own intelligence and when he have once call her forth from nonexistence into existence he make her a holy spouse an allsacred temple for himself and for the father this also he clearly declares and confesses in the follow word i will dwell in them and will walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people such be the perfect and purify soul so make from the begin a to bear the image of the celestial word but when by the envy and zeal of the malignant demon she become of her own voluntary choice sensual and a lover of evil the deity left her and a if bereft of a protector she become an easy prey and readily accessible to those who have long envy her and be assail by the battery and machine of her invisible enemy and spiritual foe she suffer a terrible fall so that not one stone of virtue remain upon another in her but she lay completely dead upon the ground entirely divest of her natural idea of god but a she who have be make in the image of god thus lay prostrate it be not that wild boar from the forest which we see that despoil her but a certain destroy demon and spiritual wild beast who deceive her with their passion a with the fiery dart of their own wickedness and burn the truly divine sanctuary of god with fire and profane to the ground the tabernacle of his name then bury the miserable one with heap of earth they destroyed every hope of deliverance but that divinely bright and save word her protector after she have suffer the merit punishment for her sin again restore her secure the favor of the allmerciful father have won over first the soul of the high ruler he purify through the agency of those most divinely favor prince the whole earth from all the impious destroyer and from the terrible and godhating tyrant themselves then bring out into the light those who be his friend who have long before be consecrate to him for life but in the midst a it be of a storm of evil have be conceal under his shelter he honor them worthily with the great gift of the spirit and again by mean of them he clear out and clean with spade and mattock the admonitory word of doctrine the soul which a little while before have be cover with filth and burden with every kind of matter and rubbish of impious ordinance and when he have make the ground of all your mind clean and clear he finally commit it to this all wise and godbeloved ruler who be endow with judgment and prudence a well a with other gift and be able to examine and discriminate accurately the mind of those commit to his charge from the first day so to speak down to the present have not cease to build now he have supply the brilliant gold again the refine and unalloyed silver and the precious and costly stone in all of you so that again be fulfil for you in fact a sacred and mystic prophecy which say behold i make thy stone a carbuncle and thy foundation of sapphire and thy battlement of jasper and thy gate of crystal and thy wall of chosen stone and all thy son shall be taught of god and thy child shall enjoy complete peace and in righteousness shall thou be built building therefore in righteousness he divide the whole people accord to their strength with some he fortify only the outer enclosure wall it up with unfeigned faith such be the great mass of the people who be incapable of bearing a great structure others he permit to enter the building command them to stand at the door and act a guide for those who should come in these may be not unfitly compare to the vestibule of the temple others he support by the first pillar which be place without about the quadrangular hall initiate them into the first element of the letter of the four gospel still others he join together about the basilica on both side these be the catechumen who be still advance and progress and be not far separate from the inmost view of divine thing grant to the faithful take from among these the pure soul that have be cleanse like gold by divine wash he then support them by pillar much well than those without make from the inner and mystic teaching of the scripture and illumines them by window adorn the whole temple with a great vestibule of the glory of the one universal king and only god and place on either side of the authority of the father christ and the holy spirit a second light he exhibit abundantly and gloriously throughout the entire building the clearness and splendor of the truth of the rest in all it detail and have select from every quarter the living and move and wellprepared stone of the soul he construct out of them all the great and royal house splendid and full of light both within and without for not only soul and understand but their body also be make glorious by the blooming ornament of purity and modesty and in this temple there be also throne and a great number of seat and bench in all those soul in which sit the holy spirit gift such a be anciently see by the sacred apostle and those who be with them when there appear unto them tongue part asunder like a of fire and sat upon each one of them but in the leader of all it be reasonable to suppose that christ himself dwells in his fullness and in those that occupy the second rank after him in proportion a each be able to contain the power of christ and of the holy spirit and the soul of some m of those namely who be commit to each of them for instruction and care may be seat for angel but the great and august and unique altar what else could this be than the pure holy of holy of the soul of the common priest of all stand at the right of it jesus himself the great high priest of the universe the only begotten of god receives with bright eye and extend hand the sweet incense from all and the bloodless and immaterial sacrifice offer in their prayer and bear them to the heavenly father and god of the universe and he himself first worship him and alone give to the father the reverence which be his due beseeching him also to continue always kind and propitious to u all such be the great temple which the great creator of the universe the word have built throughout the entire world make it an intellectual image upon earth of those thing which lie above the vault of heaven so that throughout the whole creation include rational being on earth his father might be honor and adore but the region above the heaven with the model of earthly thing which be there and the socalled jerusalem above and the heavenly mount of zion and the supramundane city of the living god in which innumerable choir of angel and the church of the first born whose name be write in heaven praise their maker and the supreme ruler of the universe with hymn of praise unutterable and incomprehensible to u who that be mortal be able worthily to celebrate this for eye hath not see nor ear heard neither have enter into the heart of men those thing which god hath prepared for them that love him since we men child and woman small and great be already in part partaker of these thing let u not cease all together with one spirit and one soul to confess and praise the author of such great benefit to u who forgiveth all our iniquity who healeth all our disease who redeemeth our life from destruction who crowneth u with mercy and compassion who satisfieth our desire with good thing for he hath not dealt with u accord to our sin nor reward u accord to our iniquity for a far a the east be from the west so far hath he remove our iniquity from u like a a father pitieth his own child so the lord pitieth them that fear him rekindle these thought in our memory both now and during all time to come and contemplate in our mind night

now rise let u beseech him with loud voice to shelter and preserve u to the end in his fold grant his unbroken and unshaken peace forever in christ jesus our savior through whom be the glory unto him

decree which they issue indicate that the grant be make to the catholic church alone greet to thee our most esteem anulinus it be the custom of our benevolence most esteem anulinus to will that those thing which belong of right to another should not only be left unmolested but should also be restore wherefore it be our will that when thou receivest this letter if any such thing belong to the catholic church of the christian in any city or other place but be now held by citizen or by any others thou shalt cause them to be restore immediately to the say church for we have already determine that those thing which these same church formerly possess shall be restore to them since therefore thy devotedness perceives that this command of ours be most explicit do thou make haste to restore to them a quickly a possible everything which formerly belong to the say churcheswhether garden or building or whatever they may be that we may learn that thou hast obeyed this decree of ours most carefully farewell our most esteem and beloved anulinus copy of an epistle in which the emperor command that a synod of bishop be held at rome in behalf of the unity and concorrd of the church constantine augustus to miltiades bishop of rome and to marcus since many such communication have be sent to me by anulinus the most illustrious proconsul of africa in which it be say that caecilianus bishop of the city of carthage have be accuse by some of his colleague in africa in many matter and since it seem to me a very serious thing that in those province which divine providence have freely entrust to my devotedness and in which there be a great population the multitude be found follow the baser course and divide a it be into two party and the bishop be at variance it have seem good to me that caecilianus himself with ten of the bishop that appear to accuse him and with ten others whom he may consider necessary for his defense should sail to rome that there in the presence of yourselves and of retecius and maternus and marinus your colleague whom i have command to hasten to rome for this purpose he may be heard a you may understand to be in accordance with the most holy law but in order that you may be enable to have most perfect knowledge of all these thing i have subjoin to my letter copy of the document sent to me by anulinus and have sent them to your abovementioned colleague when your firmness have read these you will consider in what way the abovementioned case may be most accurately investigate and justly decide for it do not escape your diligence that i have such reverence for the legitimate catholic church that i do not wish you to leave schism or division in any place may the divinity of the great god preserve you most honor sir for many year copy of an epistle in which the emperor command another synod to be held for the purpose of remove all dissension among the bishop constantine augustus to chrestus bishop of syracuse when some begin wickedly and perversely to disagree among themselves in regard to the holy worship and celestial power and catholic doctrine wish to put an end to such dispute among them i formerly give command that certain bishop should be sent from gaul and that the oppose party who be contend persistently and incessantly with each other should be summon from africa that in their presence and in the presence of the bishop of rome the matter which appear to be cause the disturbance might be examine and decide with all care but since a it happens some forgetful both of their own salvation and of the reverence due to the most holy religion do not even yet bring hostility to an end and be unwilling to conform to the judgment already pass and assert that those who express their opinion and decision be few or that they have be too hasty and precipitate in give judgment before all the thing which ought to have be accurately investigate have be examine on account of all this it have happen that those very one who ought to hold brotherly and harmonious relation toward each other be shamefully or rather abominably divide among themselves and give occasion for ridicule to those men whose soul be alien to this most holy religion wherefore it have seem necessary to me to provide that this dissension which ought to have cease after the judgment have be already give by their own voluntary agreement should now if possible be brought to an end by the presence of many since therefore we have command a number of bishop from a great many different place to assemble in the city of arles before the kalends of august we have thought proper to write to thee also that thou shouldst secure from the most illustrious latronianus corrector of sicily a public vehicle and that thou shouldst take with thee two others of the second rank whom thou thyself shalt choose together with three servant who may serve you on the way and betake thyself to the abovementioned place before the appoint day that by thy firmness and by the wise unanimity and harmony of the others present this dispute which have disgracefully continued until the present time in consequence of certain shameful strife after all have be heard which those have to say who be now at variance with one another and whom we have likewise command to be present may be settle in accordance with the proper faith and that brotherly harmony though it be but gradually may be restore may the almighty god preserve thee in health for many year chapter copy of an imperial epistle in which money be grant to the church constantine a ugustus to caecilianus bishop of carthage since it be our pleasure that something should be grant in all the province of africa and numidia and mauritania to certain minister of the legitimate and most holy catholic religion to defray their expense i have write to ursus the illustrious finance minister of africa and have direct him to make provision to pay to thy firmness three thousand folles do thou therefore when thou hast receive the above sum of money command that it be distribute among all those mention above accord to the brief sent to thee by hosius but if thou shouldst find that anything be want for the fulfillment of this purpose of mine in regard to all of them thou shalt demand without hesitation from heracleides our treasurer whatever thou findest to be necessary for i command him when he be present that if thy firmness should ask him for any money he should see to it that it be paid without delay and since i have learn that some men of unsettled mind wish to turn the people from the most holy and catholic church by a certain method of shameful corruption do thou know that i give command to anulinus the proconsul and also to patricius vicar of the prefect when they be present that they should give proper attention not only to other matter but also above all to this and that they should not overlook such a thing when it happen wherefore if thou shouldst see any such men continue in this madness do thou without delay go to the abovementioned judge and report the matter to them that they may correct them a i command them when they be present the divinity of the great god preserve thee for many year chapter the exemption of the clergy copy of an epistle in which the emperor command that the ruler of the church be exempt from all political duty greet to thee our most esteem anulinus since it appear from many circumstance that when that religion be despise in which be preserve the chief reverence for the most holy celestial power great danger be brought upon public affair but that when legally adopt and observe it affords the most signal prosperity to the roman name and remarkable felicity to all the affair of men through the divine beneficence it have seem good to me most esteem anulinus that those men who give their service with due sanctity and with constant observance of this law to the worship of the divine religion should receive recompense for their labor wherefore it be my will that those within the province entrust to thee in the catholic church over which caecilianus presides who give their service to this holy religion and who be commonly call clergyman be entirely exempt from all public duty that they may not by any error or sacrilegious negligence be drawn away from the service due to the deity but may devote themselves without any hindrance to their own law for it seem that when they show great reverence to the deity the great benefit accrue to the state farewell our most esteem and beloved anulinus chapter the subsequent wickedness of licinius and his death such blessing do divine and heavenly grace confer upon u through the appearance of our savior and such be the abundance of benefit which prevail among all men in consequence of the peace which we enjoy and thus be our affair crown with rejoicing and festivity but malignant envy and the demon who love that which be evil be not able to bear the sight of these thing and moreover the event that befell the tyrant whom we have already mention be not sufficient to bring licinius to sound reason for the latter although his government be prosperous and he be honor with the second rank after the great emperor constantine and be connect with him by the closest tie of marriage abandon the imitation of good deed and emulate the wickedness of the impious tyrant whose end he have see with his own eye and chose rather to follow their principle than to continue in friendly relation with him who be well than they be envious of the common benefactor he wag an impious and most terrible war against him pay regard neither to law of nature nor treaty nor blood and give no thought to covenant for constantine like an allgracious emperor give him evidence of true favor do not refuse alliance with him and do not refuse him the illustrious marriage with his sister but honor him by make him a partaker of the ancestral nobility and the ancient imperial blood and grant him the right of share in the dominion over all a a brotherinlaw and coregent confer upon him the government and administration of no less a portion of the roman province than he himself possess but licinius on the contrary pursue a course directly opposite to this form daily all kind of plot against his superior and devise all sort of mischief that he might repay his benefactor with evil at first he attempt to conceal his preparation and pretend to be a friend and practice frequently fraud and deceit in the hope that he might easily accomplish the desire end but god be the friend protector and guardian of constantine and bring the plot which have be form in secrecy and darkness to the light he foil them so much virtue do the great armor of piety posse for the ward off of enemy and for the preservation of our own safety protect by this our most divinely favor emperor escape the multitudinous plot of the abominable man but when licinius perceive that his secret preparation by no mean progress accord to his mind for god reveal every plot and wickedness to the godfavored emperor be no longer able to conceal himself he undertook an open war and at the same time that he determine to wage war with constantine he also proceed to join battle with the god of the universe whom he knew that constantine worship and begin gently for a time and quietly to attack his pious subject who have never do his government any harm this he do under the compulsion of his innate wickedness which drove him into terrible blindness he do not therefore keep before his eye the memory of those who have persecute the christian before him nor of those whose destroyer and executioner he have be appoint on account of the impiety which they have commit but depart from sound reason be seize in a word with insanity he determine to war against god himself a the ally of constantine instead of against the one who be assist by him and in the first place he drove from his house every christian thus deprive himself wretched man of the prayer which they offer to god in his behalf which they be accustom accord to the teach of their father to offer for all men then he command that the soldier in the city should be cashier and strip of their rank unless they chose to sacrifice to the demon and yet these be small matter when compare with the great thing that follow why be it necessary to relate minutely and in detail all that be do by the hater of god and to recount how this most lawless man invent unlawful law he pass an ordinance that no one should exercise humanity toward the sufferer in prison by give them food and that none should show mercy to those that be perish of hunger in bond that no one should in any way be kind or do any good act even though move by nature herself to sympathize with one neighbor and this be indeed an openly shameful and most cruel law calculate to expel all natural kindliness and in addition to this it be also decreed a a punishment that those who show compassion should suffer the same thing with those whom they compassionate and that those who kindly minister to the suffer should be thrown into bond and into prison and should endure the same punishment with the sufferer such be the decree of licinius why should we recount his innovation in regard to marriage or in regard to the die innovation by which he venture to annul the ancient law of the roman which have be well and wisely form and to introduce certain barbarous and cruel law which be truly unlawful and lawless he invent to the detriment of the province which be subject to him innumerable prosecution and all sort of method of extort gold and silver new measurement of land and injurious exaction from men in the country who be no longer living but long since dead why be it necessary to speak at length of the banishment which in addition to these thing this enemy of mankind inflict upon those who have do no wrong the expatriation of men of noble birth and high reputation whose young wife he snatch from them and consign to certain baser fellow of his own to be shamefully abuse by them and the many married woman and virgin upon whom he gratify his passion although he be in advanced age why i say be it necessary to speak at length of these thing when the excessive wickedness of his last deed make the first appear small and of no account for finally he reach such a pitch of madness that he attack the bishop suppose that they a servant of the god over all would be hostile to his measure he do not yet proceed against them openly on account of his fear of his superior but a before secretly and craftily employ the treachery of the governor for the destruction of the most distinguish of them and the manner of their murder be strange and such a have never before be heard of the deed which he perform at amaseia and in the other city of pontus surpass every excess of cruelty some of the church of god be again raze to the ground others be close so that none of those accustom to frequent them could enter them and render the worship due to god for his evil conscience lead him to suppose that prayer be not offer in his behalf but he be persuade that we do everything in the interest of the godbeloved emperor and that we supplicate god for him therefore he hasten to turn his fury against u and then those among the governor who wish to flatter him perceive that in do such thing they pleased the impious tyrant make some of the bishop suffer the penalty customarily inflict upon criminal and lead away and without any pretext punish like murderer those who have do no wrong some now endure a new form of death have their body cut into many piece with the sword and after this savage and most horrible spectacle be thrown into the depth of the sea a food for fish thereupon the worshiper of god again flee and field and desert forest and mountain again receive the servant of christ and when the impious tyrant have thus met with success in these measure he finally plan to renew the persecution against all and he would have succeed in his design and there would have be nothing to hinder him in the work have not god the defender of the life of his own people most quickly anticipate that which be about to happen and cause a great light to shine forth a in the midst of a dark and gloomy night and raise up a deliverer for lead into those region with a lofty arm his servant constantine chapter the victory of constantine and the blessing which under him accrue to the subject of the roman empire to him therefore god grant from heaven above the deserve fruit of piety the trophy of victory over the impious and he cast the guilty one with all his counselor and friend prostrate at the foot
